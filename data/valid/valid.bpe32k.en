Norway &apos;s r@@ ak@@ f@@ is@@ k : is this the world &apos;s s@@ mel@@ li@@ est fish ?
Norway &apos;s five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living , not just in Europe , but in the world .
could the secret of the country &apos;s success be connected to the local appe@@ ti@@ te for some ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly s@@ mel@@ ly fish ?
take a selection of over @-@ ri@@ pe che@@ es@@ es .
place them in the mid@@ st of a p@@ ile of dir@@ ty , w@@ et soccer k@@ it .
leave for a week .
now you have the n@@ ose @-@ n@@ um@@ bing s@@ me@@ ll of r@@ ak@@ f@@ is@@ k , one of the great Norwegian De@@ lic@@ ac@@ ies .
I am in the small town of F@@ ag@@ er@@ n@@ es , about three hours from Oslo .
there is snow , spec@@ tac@@ ular sc@@ ener@@ y - and that od@@ our , ever present , han@@ gs in the air .
R@@ ak@@ f@@ is@@ k is tro@@ ut sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led with sal@@ t and fer@@ men@@ ted in water for - depending on how s@@ mel@@ ly you like your fish - up to a year .
as the dark sets in and the weather turns cold , N@@ or@@ we@@ gi@@ ans flo@@ ck to a festival here in F@@ ag@@ er@@ n@@ es devoted to this most , well , cap@@ ti@@ v@@ ating of fo@@ ods .
&quot; you eat it ra@@ w , and then sw@@ allow a glass of a@@ qu@@ av@@ it , &quot; says H@@ av@@ ard Hal@@ var@@ sen , full @-@ time local fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ter but also the so @-@ called &quot; R@@ ak@@ f@@ is@@ k General , &quot; in charge of running the festival .
all around us people are e@@ ating little c@@ ub@@ es of the fish and kno@@ c@@ king back qu@@ anti@@ ties of dr@@ ink .
&quot; some people like the a@@ qu@@ av@@ it more than the r@@ ak@@ f@@ is@@ k , &quot; says H@@ av@@ ard .
the dr@@ ink can kill the s@@ me@@ ll .
I try a few pieces .
if you can avoid passing it under your n@@ ose , it is not bad - not unlike a sli@@ ce of s@@ us@@ hi that has been on rather a long bus journey .
R@@ ak@@ f@@ is@@ k is a product of very different , poverty @-@ stri@@ c@@ ken times in Norway when , pre @-@ ref@@ ri@@ ger@@ ation , fish was so@@ ak@@ ed in air@@ tight bar@@ rels of water and sal@@ t in autumn .
then in the de@@ p@@ ths of winter , well and truly fer@@ men@@ ted , it is taken out and - no doubt with the sen@@ ses kno@@ cked out by alcohol - e@@ a@@ ten .
only a generation ago , thousands of N@@ or@@ we@@ gi@@ ans were forced to leave their country in search of work , emig@@ rating mainly to the US .
now the population is expanding fast - more than 13 % are immigrants , attracted by p@@ len@@ ti@@ ful jobs , high wages and a comprehensive care system .
people from Sweden , the old rival and not so long ago far ri@@ cher than Norway , st@@ re@@ am in to work .
R@@ ak@@ f@@ is@@ k is seen as si@@ g@@ ni@@ fying something important , a vital if rather s@@ mel@@ ly part of Norway &apos;s past .
it is among the more expensive dis@@ hes you can buy .
but then everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a s@@ and@@ w@@ ich kno@@ ck you back Â£ 9 ( $ 14 ) each .
Norway does not often make it on to the global news agenda - and most seem to like it that way .
people here are still lo@@ ath to mention by name Anders Bre@@ i@@ vi@@ k , the right @-@ wing , rac@@ ist extremist who gun@@ ned down and killed 77 men , women and children last year .
instead , the sho@@ ot@@ ings are referred to as &quot; the July the 22nd incident . &quot;
N@@ or@@ we@@ gi@@ ans find it very difficult to believe that in their peace @-@ lov@@ ing country one of their own was capable of such bru@@ tal@@ ity and murder .
the growth since the early 197@@ 0s of one of the world &apos;s biggest oil and gas industries lies behind much of Norway &apos;s present @-@ day wealth .
&quot; but oil is not the only reason we are doing so well , &quot; says Anna our wa@@ it@@ ress , handing round tr@@ ays of ma@@ turing r@@ ak@@ f@@ is@@ k and , with her long b@@ l@@ on@@ d ha@@ ir and st@@ art@@ l@@ ingly blue eyes , the image of N@@ or@@ dic well @-@ being .
we are a - how you say - p@@ ru@@ dent people .
her English , like that of most people here , is f@@ la@@ w@@ less .
we are not very show@@ y , we do not like os@@ ten@@ tation .
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - all but a small percentage of money from the industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations .
when everyone else was th@@ ro@@ wing around money they did not have , in the years leading up to the global financial crash , Norway kept its pur@@ se str@@ ings tigh@@ tly bound .
&quot; as long as we can ski in winter and go hi@@ king in summer we are happy , &quot; says Anna .
&quot; and eat r@@ ak@@ f@@ is@@ k , &quot; she adds with a car@@ ef@@ ree la@@ ug@@ h .
I stand in the snow and qu@@ e@@ ue for something to eat - I have had enough r@@ ak@@ f@@ is@@ k .
now an el@@ k bur@@ ger is certainly something different and rather suc@@ cul@@ ent to the tas@@ te .
but in the evening , it is more of that s@@ mel@@ ly fish .
the hotel I am staying in is one of a number of venues hosting a r@@ ak@@ f@@ is@@ k din@@ ner where guests vote on the best - or perhaps the most nas@@ ally challenging - fish .
there is a live TV link up to a comp@@ ere in a bo@@ w ti@@ e sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by plates of r@@ ak@@ f@@ is@@ k .
it is like the Eurovision song contest .
&quot; what score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains Th@@ or @-@ Ju@@ er@@ g@@ en ? &quot;
&quot; here are our points , H@@ av@@ ard . &quot;
there is cl@@ apping , la@@ ug@@ h@@ ter .
a man falls off his chair , perhaps overcome with a@@ qu@@ av@@ it .
or maybe it is the fu@@ mes from all that fish .
M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o &apos;s En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ e@@ to faces tough start
as M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o &apos;s in@@ coming President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ e@@ to prepares to take office , the BBC &apos;s W@@ ill G@@ rant looks at the challenges facing him and the mixed expectations of his population .
traffic in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o City is particularly bad at present .
a con@@ ges@@ ted city at the best of times , a ring of steel has been er@@ ected since Monday cutting off several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads .
the aim , however , wasn &apos;t to stop com@@ mu@@ ters getting to work but prevent protesters from reaching parliament .
on Saturday , M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o &apos;s new president En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ e@@ to will receive the presidential s@@ ash and take over the running of the nation .
he faces a complicated task .
M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o has been performing well economically under the outgoing administration of F@@ eli@@ pe Cal@@ der@@ on , but the country is in the gri@@ p of a drug war , which has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years .
&quot; my government has a great commitment to the M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an people to reduce the violence , &quot; M@@ r P@@ ena Ni@@ e@@ to told US President Barack Obama in the O@@ val Office earlier this week .
I will be proposing a new security strategy which will allow us to achieve that aim .
before ru@@ b@@ bing sho@@ ul@@ ders with the US president , M@@ r P@@ ena Ni@@ e@@ to &apos;s previous political experience was as governor of his home state , the State of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o .
a p@@ op@@ ul@@ ous , sp@@ ra@@ w@@ ling state surrounding the capital , opinions about the new leader are divided in his old st@@ om@@ ping ground .
a stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward man
in the bu@@ col@@ ic town of Val@@ le del Bra@@ vo , for example , he is remember@@ ed f@@ on@@ dly .
residents credit him with boosting tourism in the resort and building infrastructure .
to reach the town you can drive along one of M@@ r P@@ ena Ni@@ e@@ to &apos;s new motor@@ ways , a vast improvement on the cr@@ ac@@ ked and b@@ ump@@ y roads it replaced .
pla@@ ques bearing his name also han@@ g outside a modern sports centre and an impressive inter@@ active museum about climate change .
&quot; we are looking to him to bring about real and lasting change , &quot; says friend and political ally Gabriel Ol@@ ver@@ a Her@@ n@@ an@@ de@@ z , a state Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man for M@@ r P@@ ena Ni@@ e@@ to &apos;s party , the PR@@ I .
particularly in terms of security and the economy , we &apos;re hoping for an interesting and true change which our country so badly needs .
after an un@@ broken 81 years in power , the PR@@ I was ous@@ ted in 2000 by Vic@@ en@@ te Fo@@ x .
Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man Ol@@ ver@@ a ad@@ mits that after 12 years outside the presidential pal@@ ace of L@@ os P@@ in@@ os , there is much expec@@ tation within the party about En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ e@@ to .
and he rejects the opposition &apos;s character@@ isation of the new president as lacking sub@@ stance .
he &apos;s a very stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward man , very committed with an excellent vision of the country .
he &apos;s an excellent st@@ a@@ tes@@ man and , above all , he &apos;s someone who knows how to listen .
but on the other side of the state , that is not the impression many people have of their former governor .
in Ne@@ z@@ ah@@ u@@ al@@ co@@ y@@ ot@@ l , also known as Ci@@ u@@ da@@ d Ne@@ za , the contrast with the co@@ b@@ b@@ led streets of Val@@ le del Bra@@ vo couldn &apos;t be s@@ har@@ per .
tu@@ cked away under motor@@ way fl@@ y@@ ov@@ ers , it is in many ways a su@@ bur@@ b of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o City itself .
and the problems in the municipality are also gr@@ it@@ ty and urban .
earlier this year , the military was called in to help tackle the drug gangs operating in the ne@@ igh@@ bour@@ ho@@ ods , and violence against women is particularly ac@@ ute .
on a pat@@ ch of was@@ te@@ land by a vast land@@ fill site , the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been d@@ um@@ ped over the past two years alone .
more than 1,000 women were killed in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o State while M@@ r P@@ ena Ni@@ e@@ to was governor , a rate much higher than in the not@@ ori@@ ously violent city of Ci@@ u@@ da@@ d Ju@@ ar@@ e@@ z - a place syn@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous with the murder of innocent women .
M@@ r P@@ ena Ni@@ e@@ to &apos;s critics say , at best , he failed to adequately address the problem of f@@ em@@ ic@@ ide while he was in office .
at worst , they ac@@ c@@ use his administration of turning a b@@ lin@@ d eye .
in a concrete home t@@ y@@ p@@ ical of the run@@ down neighbourhood , Ir@@ in@@ ea Bu@@ en@@ di@@ a st@@ ru@@ g@@ g@@ les to fight back the te@@ ars as she shows me photos of her late daughter , Mari@@ ana L@@ una .
according to the official version of events , Mari@@ ana committed suicide in 2010 .
however her family believes she was murdered by her partner .
&quot; when I arrived at her house it seemed her body had been was@@ hed , &quot; Sen@@ ora Bu@@ en@@ di@@ a rec@@ al@@ ls .
there were signs she &apos;d been beaten , and ri@@ g@@ or mor@@ tis had already set in .
as her mother re@@ counts the story , a picture of Mari@@ ana looks down from the walls , next to a cross bearing a single word : justice .
however , that is exactly what the family say they have been denied .
the state authorities have treated me like I &apos;m an old g@@ os@@ si@@ p , a trouble @-@ maker , a wh@@ in@@ er .
what they want is that one simply ac@@ cep@@ ts what they say and sh@@ u@@ ts up .
&quot; but that can &apos;t be right when there were so many irregularities and om@@ is@@ sions , &quot; she says .
as President P@@ ena Ni@@ e@@ to receives the s@@ ash on Saturday , it comes with a heavy responsibility .
tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o over the past six years and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his time in office .
&quot; I hope he &apos;s the same kind of president as he was a governor , &quot; says PR@@ I Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man Ol@@ ver@@ a in Val@@ le del Bra@@ vo .
that , however , is exactly what victims &apos; families in Ci@@ u@@ da@@ d Ne@@ za most fear .
Bra@@ d@@ ley man@@ ning didn &apos;t complain about mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , prosecutors conten@@ d
prosecutors try to counter Bra@@ d@@ ley man@@ ning &apos;s claims of abuse in con@@ fin@@ ement
the hearing focuses on man@@ ning &apos;s time in the military Bri@@ g at Qu@@ anti@@ co , Vir@@ gin@@ ia
defen@@ se wants case dismissed on grounds that man@@ ning &apos;s con@@ fin@@ ement was harsh
the Army private is accused of ste@@ aling thousands of classified documents
prosecutors tried to establish Friday that Army private Bra@@ d@@ ley man@@ ning -- charged in the largest le@@ ak of classified material in U@@ .@@ S@@ . history -- missed multiple opportunities to complain about the mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment he &apos;s al@@ leg@@ ing he suffered in military custody .
while cross @-@ exam@@ ining man@@ ning at a pre @-@ trial hearing at FT . Me@@ ade , Mar@@ y@@ land , prosecutor Maj@@ . A@@ sh@@ den Fe@@ in as@@ ser@@ ted that records of weekly visits man@@ ning had with unit officers during nine months of detention at Qu@@ anti@@ co , Vir@@ gin@@ ia , show no complaints about his treatment .
the cross @-@ exam@@ in@@ ation -- during a hearing on a defen@@ se motion to have man@@ ning &apos;s case dismissed on grounds that his con@@ fin@@ ement has been harsh and has amounted to enough punishment -- came a day after man@@ ning tes@@ ti@@ fied that he had considered suicide while in custody .
the Army intelligence analyst , arrested in June 2010 , is accused of ste@@ aling thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq .
the material was then published online by W@@ ik@@ i@@ Le@@ ak@@ s .
W@@ ik@@ i@@ Le@@ ak@@ s has never confirmed that man@@ ning was the source of its information .
in Friday &apos;s hearing , Fe@@ in reviewed with man@@ ning the forms that officers filled out after meeting with man@@ ning during his detention at Qu@@ anti@@ co &apos;s Bri@@ g , where he was held under a he@@ igh@@ tened con@@ fin@@ ement status from July 2010 to April 2011 .
officers would ask man@@ ning questions and write down his respon@@ ses .
when Fe@@ in asked about the forms Friday , man@@ ning acknowledged that he rated treatment by his guards as &quot; excellent &quot; and treatment by the facility overall as &quot; very professional . &quot;
the forms show no complaints of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , even though the officers asked man@@ ning directly about his treatment , Fe@@ in conten@@ ded .
man@@ ning responded that he would ver@@ b@@ ally express concern about issues and that the visiting officers would talk through the concerns and indicate that they would be addressed , but they didn &apos;t record the issues .
&quot; they would write down &apos; no issues &apos; ( after discussing the concerns ) , and it didn &apos;t necessarily mean I didn &apos;t bring something up , &quot; man@@ ning said .
the judge , Army Col@@ . D@@ en@@ ise L@@ in@@ d , also asked man@@ ning why he didn &apos;t complain about his treatment during a January 2011 meeting with a board exam@@ ining the su@@ ic@@ id@@ al th@@ ou@@ ghts he expressed in a form months earlier .
man@@ ning rep@@ lied that his intention during that meeting was to get his &quot; prevention of in@@ j@@ ur@@ y &quot; status down@@ gra@@ ded .
the military said they put him on this restric@@ tive status -- a step below suicide watch -- for his protection and the safety of others .
&quot; I wanted staff to know I was fine , and ( I wanted to ) get off the P@@ O@@ I status ... to enjoy an increased quality of life from my vi@@ e@@ w@@ point , &quot; man@@ ning said .
man@@ ning tes@@ ti@@ fied Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Ku@@ wait , where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the Bri@@ g at Mar@@ ine B@@ ase Qu@@ anti@@ co in Vir@@ gin@@ ia in July 2010 .
he said he con@@ tem@@ pla@@ ted suicide in Ku@@ wait and once passed out there due to the heat .
he said not being allowed to know what was happening to him or in the outside world was dist@@ res@@ sing .
&quot; my world just sh@@ r@@ ink to Camp A@@ ra@@ f@@ j@@ on , to that c@@ age , &quot; man@@ ning said Thursday .
I thought I was going to die in that c@@ age .
once at Qu@@ anti@@ co , man@@ ning said , he spend most days in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours -- with no company .
man@@ ning said he was allowed only a mat@@ t@@ ress , b@@ lan@@ ket , f@@ li@@ p @-@ fl@@ op@@ s , some clo@@ th@@ es and his g@@ l@@ ass@@ es .
he said he tried to keep moving , because sle@@ eping during the day or even lying down was against the rules .
man@@ ning said he always sle@@ pt with light from outside his cell in his eyes .
if guards could not see his face when he r@@ ol@@ led over at night , he said they would wake him to r@@ ol@@ l back over .
man@@ ning &apos;s lawyer filed a formal objec@@ tion to man@@ ning &apos;s treatment in January 2011 .
man@@ ning was moved to the military prison at For@@ t Le@@ av@@ en@@ worth , Kan@@ sa@@ s , in April 2011 .
also Friday , the judge asked man@@ ning about an al@@ leg@@ ation that he made in Thursday &apos;s testimony -- that after being forced to sle@@ ep n@@ ak@@ ed one night in his Qu@@ anti@@ co cell , he was forced to stand n@@ ak@@ ed in front of guards and other in@@ ma@@ tes during a morning head count .
man@@ ning had tes@@ ti@@ fied that he was never given a chance to cover himself with his b@@ lan@@ ket during the head count .
under questioning from the judge Friday , man@@ ning said that he in@@ fer@@ red from his guard &apos;s order that he should drop a b@@ lan@@ ket that could have covered him , but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it .
man@@ ning tes@@ ti@@ fied Thursday that he was forced to sle@@ ep n@@ ak@@ ed the previous night because of his attempt to show an officer that he wasn &apos;t a danger to himself .
man@@ ning said that he told the officer that he could have used the wa@@ ist@@ band of his under@@ wear or his f@@ li@@ p @-@ fl@@ op@@ s to hurt himself but ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t done so .
that night , man@@ ning tes@@ ti@@ fied , his under@@ wear , f@@ li@@ p @-@ fl@@ op@@ s and g@@ l@@ ass@@ es were removed from his cell .
his lawyers hope the judge will at least take his experiences during con@@ fin@@ ement into account and sharply reduce his sentence should he be convicted at his court @-@ mar@@ ti@@ al , which is expected to begin early next year .
the defen@@ se has said it plans to have man@@ ning ple@@ ad guilty to les@@ s@@ er offen@@ ses and fight other charges as being too extreme .
the hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend , with prosecutors expected to argue that the detention conditions were war@@ ran@@ ted .
the P@@ ent@@ ag@@ on has maintained that man@@ ning was held in accordance with rules governing all maximum @-@ custody detainees at Qu@@ anti@@ co .
counts against man@@ ning include ai@@ ding the en@@ em@@ y , w@@ r@@ ong@@ fully causing intelligence to be published on the Internet , trans@@ mit@@ ting national defen@@ se information and theft of public property or records .
if he &apos;s convicted on all counts , he could face a life sentence .
my M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an @-@ American identity crisis
he says many were forced to leave M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o because of the lack of opportunities there
M@@ ex@@ ic@@ ans tend to fa@@ ul@@ t those who left ; they re@@ mind M@@ ex@@ ic@@ ans of hard times , he says
N@@ av@@ ar@@ re@@ t@@ te says M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an @-@ Americans are caught between two wor@@ l@@ ds
on a recent trip to M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o City , I had bar@@ ely made my way down the con@@ course and arrived at the immigration processing area when I got st@@ um@@ ped .
signs pointed the way to two lines : one for &quot; M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an@@ os &quot; ( &quot; M@@ ex@@ ic@@ ans &quot; ) , another for &quot; Ex@@ tr@@ an@@ j@@ er@@ os &quot; ( &quot; Fo@@ re@@ ig@@ ners . &quot; )
I stood there for a few seconds , un@@ sure of where to go .
growing up in Central C@@ ali@@ for@@ n@@ ia , I had been called a &quot; M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an &quot; my entire life .
it &apos;s ethnic sh@@ or@@ th@@ and in the same way that my friends in Bos@@ ton refer to themselves as &quot; Irish &quot; or my friends in New York describe themselves as &quot; Italian . &quot;
later , I settled on &quot; M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an @-@ American . &quot;
but , this was M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o .
and , in the home@@ land of my grand@@ father , there was no need for sh@@ or@@ th@@ and or hy@@ ph@@ ens .
I was simply an American .
I speak Spanish , good enough to handle either end of an interview in that language .
but I don &apos;t have the vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary of a native , and I can &apos;t shake my American ac@@ cent .
so I took my U@@ .@@ S@@ . passport and got in the line for Ex@@ tr@@ an@@ j@@ er@@ os .
I thought about that moment this week when M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an president @-@ elect En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ e@@ to visited the White House to meet with President Obama .
on the agenda , as usual , when the leaders of these two countries meet : immigration , drugs and trade .
P@@ ena Ni@@ e@@ to was also e@@ ag@@ er to talk about the growth of the M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an economy , which is one reason that M@@ ex@@ ic@@ ans are now just as likely to stay in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o as venture to the United States .
he wants to partner with the United States and Canada , and create a European Union @-@ style trading bloc in North America .
and P@@ ena Ni@@ e@@ to vowed to continue M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o &apos;s war against the drug car@@ te@@ ls , even though he offered no spec@@ if@@ ics .
for M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with hard fe@@ el@@ ings .
most Americans probably never give a thought to the fact that , in 18@@ 48 , the United States inv@@ aded M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o and forced its leaders to sign over half their territory at the point of rif@@ le .
but for M@@ ex@@ ic@@ ans , who think in terms of centuries , not minutes , the remin@@ ders are everywhere .
so the minute that a U@@ .@@ S@@ . official says anything the least bit critical of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , you start hearing -- in the M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an press , and among the eli@@ tes -- complaints about how the Americans are en@@ cro@@ ac@@ hing upon their ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or &apos;s sovereignty .
and the children of Mon@@ te@@ z@@ um@@ a go on the war@@ path .
and yet , for M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , the really challenging relationship is with the more than 35 million M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an @-@ Americans living in the United States .
you want to talk about hard fe@@ el@@ ings ?
there is p@@ len@@ ty .
M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o has winners and los@@ ers , people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it doesn &apos;t .
the only reason you have so many people of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an an@@ ces@@ try living in cities like L@@ os An@@ ge@@ le@@ s , L@@ as V@@ eg@@ as , P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x , D@@ en@@ ver or S@@ an Antonio is because , at some point in our family tree , there was a person , maybe a par@@ ent or grand@@ par@@ ent , who was shut out from opportunity in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o and had to go north .
and more often than not , that person fit a profile -- dark s@@ kin , little education , from a poor village , et@@ c .
we &apos;re their off@@ spring , and we &apos;re lo@@ y@@ al to them .
not M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o .
and even though we may now be living the American D@@ re@@ am , having gone to good schools and taken good jobs , we can never lose sight of the fact that it &apos;s the American D@@ re@@ am we &apos;re living , and not the M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an one .
our identity might sometimes be f@@ uz@@ z@@ y , but our lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty is clear .
it &apos;s to the United States .
besides , we &apos;re aware that many of the elite M@@ ex@@ ic@@ ans in the ruling class don &apos;t like us .
the feeling is mutual .
they see us as a remin@@ der of a hum@@ ili@@ ating defeat and look down on us as in@@ fer@@ ior stock that isn &apos;t sufficiently M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an .
our Spanish will never be good enough , our ties to M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o never strong enough .
our existence is , as they see it , all about failure .
if our families ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t failed in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , they wouldn &apos;t have left .
and we wouldn &apos;t now find ourselves tr@@ apped behind the s@@ il@@ k cur@@ tain , living well in the United States but lost so@@ ul@@ s n@@ one@@ the@@ less .
my wife , who was born in Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara and came to the United States legally as a child , remin@@ ds me that there is fri@@ ction between M@@ ex@@ ic@@ ans and M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an @-@ Americans because M@@ ex@@ ic@@ ans have a f@@ ir@@ mer gr@@ as@@ p of who they are and M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an @-@ Americans res@@ ent that .
while she &apos;s a U@@ .@@ S@@ . citizen , she sees her@@ self as a part of two countries .
meanwhile , many M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an @-@ Americans I know don &apos;t feel like they &apos;re a part of either .
we love l@@ ist@@ ening to the M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an band , L@@ os Ti@@ g@@ res del N@@ or@@ te , but also to B@@ ru@@ ce S@@ pr@@ ing@@ ste@@ en .
you get the best of both wor@@ l@@ ds , but you &apos;re rooted in neither .
in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , we &apos;re seen as Americans .
and in the United States , we &apos;re considered M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an .
now , to complic@@ ate the relationship even further , as I learned during my trip , some M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an leaders and parts of the in@@ tel@@ li@@ gen@@ t@@ si@@ a want to re@@ connect with the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a .
they want to put M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an @-@ Americans to work as mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft &quot; ambassadors &quot; for M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , representing its interest in the United States .
we would tell our fellow Americans what a great country this is to visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o .
ye@@ ah .
that &apos;s not going to happen .
too many hard fe@@ el@@ ings .
and , with income in@@ equality and ra@@ mp@@ ant corruption and drug violence , many of us are not so sure that it is a great country .
I &apos;m afraid you &apos;re on your own , am@@ ig@@ os .
that &apos;s fair .
if at least some M@@ ex@@ ic@@ ans ar@@ en &apos;t yet ready to for@@ give the United States for how it treated M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o a century and a half ago , then they have to accept the fact that some M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an @-@ Americans still hold a g@@ ru@@ d@@ ge for how their family members were treated much more recently than that .
H@@ m@@ m@@ m .
maybe we &apos;re more &quot; M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an &quot; than I thought .
old batt@@ les , new Middle East
the ceasefire between Israel and H@@ ama@@ s could yet be an unlikely foundation for peace
can there ever be a lasting peace between Ara@@ bs and Jews in the Middle East ?
another round of blo@@ od@@ shed suggests that any such hope is v@@ ain .
amid the usual fu@@ tile arguments over who started it , scores of buildings have been reduced to ru@@ b@@ ble ; more than 140 Pal@@ est@@ in@@ ians , most of them civilians , and six Is@@ ra@@ e@@ lis have been killed ; and , for the first time , missiles from Gaza have lan@@ ded near T@@ el Avi@@ v , Israel &apos;s me@@ tro@@ pol@@ is , and the hol@@ y city of J@@ er@@ us@@ al@@ em .
but though the Is@@ ra@@ e@@ lis and Pal@@ est@@ in@@ ians seem st@@ uc@@ k in their ancient conflict , all around them the Middle East is changing .
the Arab spring has thrown the pieces up in the air , and , like it or not , the Pal@@ est@@ in@@ ians and Is@@ ra@@ e@@ lis are caught up in the regional turmoil .
maybe this will make their struggle blo@@ o@@ di@@ er than before .
however , there are reasons for thinking it could just break their le@@ th@@ al stalemate .
a war that is neither lost or won
at first sight , optimism looks very hard to justi@@ fy now .
even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21st holds , this week &apos;s fighting has strengthened the ha@@ w@@ ks on both sides .
the leaders of H@@ ama@@ s , the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007 , will claim to have forced the Is@@ ra@@ e@@ lis to back off , even though Gaza has taken a d@@ ru@@ b@@ bing .
despite killing some of its leaders and bot@@ tling up Gaza &apos;s 1.@@ 7m people in one of the most w@@ re@@ t@@ ched and crowded cor@@ ners of the plan@@ et , Israel has failed to destroy H@@ ama@@ s .
indeed H@@ ama@@ s is gaining on the West Bank , the other bit of Pal@@ est@@ ine currently run by its bitter rivals in F@@ at@@ ah , the more moderate Palestinian fac@@ tion .
moreover , H@@ ama@@ s &apos;s leaders may well conclude that time is on their side .
as Is@@ lam@@ ists across the Arab world have gained cl@@ out , so H@@ ama@@ s has made powerful and rich friends .
Turkey , a res@@ urgent regional power that was once Israel &apos;s clos@@ est Muslim ally , has taken up H@@ ama@@ s &apos;s cause ; so has Qatar , one of the rich@@ est and most dynamic of the G@@ ul@@ f states .
ju@@ bil@@ ant H@@ ama@@ s people say an Islamist c@@ res@@ cent is cur@@ ving around Israel , from Lebanon in the north , where the H@@ iz@@ bul@@ la@@ h party @-@ c@@ um @-@ mil@@ iti@@ a holds s@@ way , through Syria , where rebels of an increasingly Islamist b@@ ent may top@@ ple Bas@@ ha@@ r Assad , and on down through Jordan , where H@@ ama@@ s &apos;s allies are men@@ ac@@ ing the king .
above all , on Israel &apos;s southern f@@ lan@@ k , the rise of the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood under President Mu@@ ham@@ ma@@ d Mor@@ si in Egypt , by far the most p@@ op@@ ul@@ ous and pi@@ v@@ ot@@ al of Arab countries , has changed the region &apos;s balance .
H@@ os@@ ni M@@ ub@@ ar@@ ak , the secular de@@ sp@@ ot who ran Egypt for 30 years until his down@@ fall in 2011 , had little time for H@@ ama@@ s .
by contrast , the Bro@@ ther@@ hood is a co@@ us@@ in of H@@ ama@@ s , and its leaders are more subject to popular opinion .
in future diplomacy H@@ ama@@ s may emerge as an actor that cannot be shut out even by Israel and America .
meanwhile , Israel &apos;s hard@@ lin@@ ers will draw the op@@ pos@@ ite conclusions .
in military terms , H@@ ama@@ s has been put back in its box .
Israel &apos;s Ir@@ on d@@ ome anti @-@ missile system has proved its worth and many of H@@ ama@@ s &apos;s missiles have been destroyed .
Is@@ ra@@ e@@ lis will sle@@ ep more so@@ un@@ dly - for a while .
in diplomatic terms , America is as ste@@ ad@@ fast as ever ; many European countries also blamed H@@ ama@@ s for starting the latest round of violence .
above all , Israel has pros@@ per@@ ed , especially under B@@ in@@ y@@ am@@ in N@@ et@@ any@@ ah@@ u , a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process .
although roc@@ kets from Gaza have killed around 30 Is@@ ra@@ e@@ lis since 2004 , Israel has been fairly free of suicide @-@ b@@ om@@ bers , thanks in part to the bar@@ ri@@ er that Bi@@ tes into the West Bank , the main ch@@ un@@ k of a would @-@ be Palestinian state , and protec@@ ts the Jewish sett@@ le@@ ments that continue to expand despite their il@@ legality in international law .
M@@ r N@@ et@@ any@@ ah@@ u , whose L@@ ik@@ u@@ d party has mer@@ ged with an even more ha@@ w@@ k@@ ish lot under Av@@ ig@@ d@@ or Li@@ e@@ ber@@ man in the run @-@ up to an election on January 22nd , is sitting pre@@ t@@ ty .
why co@@ d@@ d@@ le those tw@@ ist@@ y Pal@@ est@@ in@@ ians by giving them a state of their own ?
if they really ran the West Bank , would they not fire roc@@ kets , just as their comp@@ at@@ riots have done in Gaza ?
better to keep them behind that wall and s@@ m@@ ite them if they raise their heads .
maybe the hard@@ lin@@ ers will win out ; yet the Arab spring may change their calc@@ ulations .
even if the Is@@ lam@@ ists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere have little love for Israel , their priority will be tackling difficulties at home .
Israel &apos;s defence budget is bigger than that of its four Arab neighbours combined .
starting a war with the local super@@ power will hardly help the new Arab governments men@@ d their economies .
that the pra@@ g@@ matic M@@ r Mor@@ si worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ceasefire a@@ ug@@ urs well - and might just mark the start of something .
Is@@ ra@@ e@@ lis too should look to the longer term .
with the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic , de@@ pri@@ ving Pal@@ est@@ in@@ ians of their right to self @-@ determination is creating a pow@@ der ke@@ g that is bound one day to explo@@ de in the territories occupied by Israel - much as a bus exploded in T@@ el Avi@@ v this week .
re@@ pression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state , and de@@ mo@@ graphy ex@@ ac@@ er@@ b@@ ates this as the Arab population s@@ wel@@ ls .
blo@@ od@@ y missions against Gaza every few years to kno@@ ck back H@@ ama@@ s will exact a growing diplomatic toll .
both sides need pro@@ d@@ ding by out@@ si@@ ders
the answer remains the one tr@@ um@@ pe@@ ted by sen@@ sible people on both sides , most of the outside world and this newspaper : two states , with Israel c@@ ed@@ ing territory for security .
the hope - a small one in the short term - is that the ceasefire will give a little more le@@ ver@@ age to out@@ si@@ ders pushing that cause .
Egypt , which must now set about st@@ op@@ ping the flow of arms into Gaza , along with Turkey and Qatar , is better placed than ever to persuade H@@ ama@@ s to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 19@@ 67 boundaries with land sw@@ aps and a shared J@@ er@@ us@@ al@@ em .
Arab out@@ si@@ ders should also press H@@ ama@@ s and F@@ at@@ ah to come together .
that would do more to create a Palestinian state than the im@@ min@@ ent bid for v@@ ir@@ tu@@ al statehood at the UN .
M@@ r Obama also has a part in getting Israel to the table .
during his first term , he neglec@@ ted to present his own plan for peace .
back in the White House , he is looking just as reluctant to be drawn in .
this is wo@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly short @-@ si@@ gh@@ ted .
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East .
that means a peace settlement between Israel and the Pal@@ est@@ in@@ ians .
cigarette pla@@ in p@@ ack@@ aging laws come into force in Australia
smoking warnings and dis@@ e@@ ased body parts em@@ bla@@ z@@ oned on d@@ ul@@ l green boxes that are the same for all tobacco br@@ an@@ ds
Australia &apos;s world @-@ first laws on cigarette and tobacco pla@@ in p@@ ack@@ aging have come into force , replacing brand lo@@ g@@ os and c@@ olo@@ urs with gener@@ ic dra@@ b ol@@ ive green c@@ over@@ ings , g@@ ru@@ es@@ ome pictures of dis@@ e@@ ased body parts and depic@@ tions of children and ba@@ bi@@ es made ill by their parents &apos; smoking .
apart from the var@@ ying health warnings and images the only difference between the p@@ ac@@ ks , mandatory from Saturday , are the brand names , and these are all pr@@ in@@ ted in identi@@ cal small f@@ on@@ t .
it is the world &apos;s most strict regime for the p@@ ack@@ aging of tobacco .
Australia &apos;s federal government says the aim is to de@@ ter young people from smoking by stri@@ pping the ha@@ bit of g@@ lam@@ our .
it is re@@ lying on studies showing that if people have not started smoking by age 26 there is a 99 % chance they will never take it up .
&quot; even from a very early age you can see that kids understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their br@@ an@@ ding , &quot; said the federal health minister , T@@ an@@ ya P@@ liber@@ se@@ k , citing studies that showed , for example , children linking a cro@@ wn in a lo@@ go with the idea of being a pr@@ inc@@ ess .
while Australia has one of the world &apos;s lowest smoking rates and the changes will have little impact on mul@@ tin@@ ation@@ als &apos; profits , other countries are considering similar steps .
the tobacco industry lob@@ bi@@ ed hard against the laws .
tobacco firms said they would boost black market trade , leading to cheaper , more ac@@ ces@@ sible cigarettes .
&quot; there will be serious un@@ intended consequences from the legislation , &quot; said S@@ c@@ ot@@ t Mc@@ In@@ t@@ y@@ re of British American T@@ ob@@ ac@@ co Australia .
counterfe@@ it@@ ers from China and In@@ don@@ es@@ ia will bring l@@ ots more of these products down to sell on the streets of Australia .
others say the laws have boosted their business .
S@@ and@@ ra H@@ a of Z@@ ic@@ o Im@@ port P@@ ty L@@ t@@ d , a small family business , said demand for cigarette cases , s@@ il@@ ic@@ on covers to mas@@ k the un@@ pal@@ at@@ able p@@ ack@@ ages , had shot up from almost nothing two months ago since British American T@@ ob@@ ac@@ co , Britain &apos;s Im@@ per@@ ial T@@ ob@@ ac@@ co , Philip Mor@@ ri@@ s and Japan T@@ ob@@ ac@@ co lost a challenge to the laws in Australia &apos;s high court .
ha said Z@@ ic@@ o had sold up to 6,000 to who@@ le@@ sale outlets and was awaiting new stock .
this is good business for us .
the potential hit@@ ch , experts say , is the popularity of social media with the very demographic the plan is targeting .
after a series of Australian laws ban@@ ning TV advertising and sports sp@@ on@@ sor@@ ship and requiring most sel@@ lers to hide cigarettes from view , tobacco marketing has moved online .
Australia has banned web advertising by local companies and sites but cannot restric@@ t over@@ se@@ as sites .
&quot; if you are a tobacco mar@@ ke@@ ter and you &apos;ve only got this small window left to promote your products , online is the comp@@ elling place for you to be in , &quot; said Bec@@ k@@ y F@@ re@@ em@@ an , a public health researcher at Sydney University .
F@@ re@@ em@@ an noted an increase in &quot; average Jo@@ e &quot; re@@ views of br@@ an@@ ds on social media sites such as Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be , T@@ w@@ it@@ ter and Facebook .
we have to ask , is that just a private citizen who really lov@@ es Mar@@ l@@ bor@@ o cigarettes and they &apos;ve gone to the trouble of making a video , or is there a marketing company involved ?
British American T@@ ob@@ ac@@ co Australia said the industry was focused on dealing with the new rules rather than marketing .
the industry has gone as far as paying for Ukraine , Hon@@ dur@@ as and the D@@ om@@ in@@ ic@@ an Republic to challenge the new rules - the countries are claiming at the World Trade Organisation that trade is being un@@ fairly restric@@ ted , despite none of the countries having significant trade with Australia .
a WTO ruling is likely in mid @-@ 2013 .
P@@ liber@@ se@@ k said the government had held discussions with other countries considering similar laws on p@@ ack@@ aging .
Canada was the first country to make photo@@ grap@@ h warnings mandatory in 2001 .
they now extend to more than 40 countries including Brazil , Turkey and Ukraine .
tou@@ gh@@ er laws are being considered in Britain , New Ze@@ al@@ and , South Africa and India .
many smokers in Australia remain de@@ fi@@ ant .
the pictures don &apos;t affect me .
I just ignore them .
&quot; you just gra@@ b a smoke and put it away , &quot; said Victor E@@ l H@@ age as he purchased a p@@ ack with a photo@@ grap@@ h of a m@@ ou@@ th t@@ um@@ our .
hon@@ est@@ ly , there &apos;s only one reason I &apos;d stop , and that &apos;s my little girl .
James Y@@ u , who runs the King of the P@@ ack to@@ bac@@ con@@ ist in central Sydney , said the uni@@ form p@@ ack@@ aging made it harder to st@@ ack his shel@@ ves
&quot; it used to take me an hour to un@@ lo@@ ad a delivery , now it takes me four hours , &quot; Y@@ u said .
&quot; the government should have just banned them altogether and then we &apos;d go O@@ K , fine , we &apos;re done , we &apos;ll shut up shop , &quot; he said , th@@ ro@@ wing his hands up in the air .
in a Con@@ stan@@ tly p@@ lu@@ gged @-@ In World , It &apos;s N@@ ot Al@@ l B@@ ad to Be bo@@ red
I spent five un@@ expected hours in an airport this T@@ han@@ k@@ s@@ giving holiday when our plane had me@@ chan@@ ical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane to arrive .
so I had p@@ len@@ ty of time to think about the subject of bo@@ re@@ dom .
I won &apos;t lie to you .
half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pre@@ t@@ ty te@@ di@@ ous , even with the dist@@ rac@@ tions of books , ma@@ g@@ az@@ ines and i@@ Ph@@ ones ( not to mention duty @-@ free shopping ) .
but increasingly , some academics and child development experts are coming out in praise of bo@@ re@@ dom .
it &apos;s all right for us - and our children - to be bo@@ red on occasion , they say .
it forces the brain to go on interesting tan@@ gen@@ ts , perhaps fostering cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity .
and because most of us are almost cons@@ ist@@ ently p@@ lu@@ gged into one s@@ cre@@ en or another these days , we don &apos;t experience the benefits of bo@@ re@@ dom .
so should we em@@ br@@ ace bo@@ re@@ dom ?
yes .
and no .
but I &apos;ll get back to that .
first of all , like many people , I assumed that bo@@ re@@ dom was a relatively recent phenomenon , with the ad@@ v@@ ent of more le@@ is@@ ure time .
not so , says Peter T@@ o@@ o@@ he@@ y , a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Cal@@ gar@@ y in Canada and the author of &quot; Bo@@ re@@ dom : a li@@ vely H@@ ist@@ ory &quot; ( Y@@ ale University Press , 2011 ) .
&quot; Bo@@ re@@ dom actually has a very long history , &quot; he said .
there &apos;s Latin gra@@ ff@@ iti about bo@@ re@@ dom on the walls of P@@ om@@ pe@@ i@@ i dating from the first century .
then there &apos;s the question of how we define bo@@ re@@ dom .
the trouble is that it has been defined , and discussed , in many different ways , said John D@@ . E@@ ast@@ wood , an associate professor of psych@@ ology at York University in On@@ tar@@ io , Canada .
after looking over the research literature and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood and his colleagues defined bo@@ re@@ dom as an experience of &quot; wan@@ ting to , but being unable to engage in s@@ ati@@ s@@ fying activity . &quot;
what separ@@ ates bo@@ re@@ dom from ap@@ ath@@ y , he said , is that the person is not engaged but wants to be .
with ap@@ ath@@ y , he said , there is no urge to do something .
the core experience of bo@@ re@@ dom , he said , is &quot; dis@@ rup@@ tion of the attention process , associated with a low mood and a sense that time is passing slowly . &quot;
Bo@@ re@@ dom can sound an aw@@ ful lot like de@@ pression .
but Professor E@@ ast@@ wood said that while they can be related , people who are bo@@ red tend to see the problem as the environment or the world , while people who are de@@ pressed see the problem as themselves .
sometimes we think we &apos;re bo@@ red when we just have di@@ ff@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty con@@ c@@ entr@@ ating .
in their study , &quot; The Un@@ engaged Min@@ d : defining Bo@@ re@@ dom in Ter@@ ms of At@@ ten@@ tion , &quot; which appeared in the jo@@ ur@@ n@@ al Per@@ spec@@ tives on psychological Science in September , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experim@@ ent in which participants l@@ ist@@ en@@ ed to a tape of a person reading a magazine article .
some groups heard a l@@ oud and un@@ related television pro@@ gra@@ m in the next room , others heard it at a low level so it was bar@@ ely noti@@ ce@@ able , while the third group didn &apos;t hear the so@@ un@@ d@@ track at all .
the ones who heard the low @-@ level TV reported more bo@@ re@@ dom than the other two groups - they had di@@ ff@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty con@@ c@@ entr@@ ating but were not sure why , and attributed that di@@ ff@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty to bo@@ re@@ dom .
when you &apos;re trying to focus on a difficult or eng@@ aging task , dis@@ rup@@ tion of attention can lead to bo@@ re@@ dom , said Mark J@@ . F@@ en@@ s@@ ke , an associate professor of ne@@ ur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence at the University of Gu@@ el@@ p@@ h in On@@ tar@@ io and one of the authors of the study .
on the other hand , when you &apos;re doing something d@@ ul@@ l , &quot; such as looking for bad w@@ id@@ gets on a factory line , dist@@ rac@@ ting music can help you not be bo@@ red . &quot;
in fact , he said , we now know that squ@@ ir@@ ming and do@@ od@@ ling , often seen as a sign of bo@@ re@@ dom , can actually help combat it by keeping people more physi@@ cally alert .
&quot; research shows that kids who are allowed to f@@ id@@ get learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still , &quot; Professor F@@ en@@ s@@ ke said .
we all experience bo@@ re@@ dom at some points - my flight delay , a d@@ r@@ on@@ ing speaker , a particularly te@@ di@@ ous movie .
but some individuals are more likely to be bo@@ red than others .
to help measure this , researchers developed a &quot; Bo@@ re@@ dom P@@ r@@ on@@ en@@ ess S@@ cal@@ e &quot; in the 1980s .
the scale includes questions like , &quot; M@@ any things I have to do are re@@ peti@@ tive and mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ous , &quot; and &quot; I have so many interests , I don &apos;t have time to do everything . &quot;
using such s@@ cal@@ es , researchers have discovered that boys tend to be bo@@ red more often than girls , said Stephen V@@ od@@ an@@ ov@@ ich , a professor of psych@@ ology at the University of West F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , especially when it comes ne@@ eding more , and a variety of , external sti@@ mu@@ lation .
but in general , te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers are a pre@@ t@@ ty j@@ aded lot .
in 1991 , Re@@ ed Lar@@ son , a professor of human and community development at the University of Il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , conducted an experim@@ ent in which he con@@ t@@ acted almost 400 te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers and their parents seven to eight times a day by be@@ ep@@ er .
he found that 32 percent of ad@@ o@@ les@@ c@@ ents said they were bo@@ red in school and doing ho@@ me@@ work , while 23 percent said they were bo@@ red when they w@@ er@@ en &apos;t in school .
on the other hand , 3 percent of parents said they were bo@@ red .
professor Lar@@ son said he did not know whether the bo@@ re@@ dom per@@ c@@ ent@@ ages now , 21 years later , would be higher or lower .
but he said he did know that &quot; ad@@ o@@ les@@ c@@ ence is a peak period for bo@@ re@@ dom , &quot; largely because children and te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers are not given a lot of control over what they want to do .
so back to my original question : is bo@@ re@@ dom good for you ?
sometimes no , because in its extreme it can lead people to take ab@@ sur@@ d physical risks , g@@ am@@ ble or in@@ d@@ ul@@ ge in sub@@ stance abuse as a way to ease it , research shows .
on the other hand , many ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ ers and writers discuss the connection between bo@@ re@@ dom and cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity , said Professor V@@ od@@ an@@ ov@@ ich , who has been studying the issue for more than two decades .
&quot; Bo@@ re@@ dom is the brain &apos;s way to tell you you should be doing something else , &quot; said G@@ ary Mar@@ cus , a professor of psych@@ ology at N@@ .@@ Y@@ .@@ U@@ .
but the brain doesn &apos;t always know the most appropriate thing to do .
if you &apos;re bo@@ red and use that energy to play gu@@ it@@ ar and co@@ ok , it will make you happy .
but if you watch TV , it may make you happy in the short term , but not in the long term .
so if your child is bo@@ red and you give him an i@@ P@@ ad , he may not be bo@@ red anymore , but he has@@ n &apos;t learned how to en@@ ter@@ tain himself , or self regulate , Professor F@@ en@@ s@@ ke said .
and &quot; that self @-@ regulation trans@@ f@@ ers from one situation to other , &quot; he said .
your k@@ id doesn &apos;t just learn to en@@ ter@@ tain himself , but gets more self @-@ control in other areas .
I don &apos;t think we really want to celebrate bo@@ re@@ dom .
nor should we be too critical of it .
rather , our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant ch@@ at@@ ter of activity and technology .
professor E@@ ast@@ wood agreed .
&quot; we frame it as we need to be bo@@ red more , but bo@@ re@@ dom is an ag@@ on@@ iz@@ ing , rest@@ less desire to be connected with something me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful , &quot; he said .
what people are really searching for , he said , is a way to un@@ p@@ lu@@ g and enjoy down time .
&quot; in an environment where we are constantly over@@ sti@@ mu@@ lated , &quot; he said , &quot; it &apos;s hard to find ways to engage when the no@@ ise sh@@ u@@ ts down . &quot;
in Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o , No P@@ lay@@ book for New mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana Law
An@@ th@@ ony O@@ ro@@ z@@ co , 19 , a community col@@ le@@ ge student and soccer player in southeastern Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o , is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across this state : the possession of a few n@@ ug@@ gets of mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana and a pip@@ e he used to smoke it .
Mr. O@@ ro@@ z@@ co said that one day in September he and a few friends were driving in L@@ ama@@ r , on the pla@@ ins near the Kan@@ sa@@ s border , when they were pul@@ led over .
after the police officer found mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana in the car , Mr. O@@ ro@@ z@@ co was issued a sum@@ m@@ ons for possession and drug par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia - p@@ et@@ ty offen@@ ses that each carry a $ 100 fine - and given a court date .
&quot; we get treated like criminals , &quot; Mr. O@@ ro@@ z@@ co said .
but is he one ?
in the uncertain weeks after Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o &apos;s vote to leg@@ al@@ ize small amounts of mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana for rec@@ re@@ ational use , the answer in hundreds of minor drug cases depends less on the law than on location .
hundreds of mis@@ de@@ me@@ an@@ or mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana cases are already being dropped here and in Washington State , which approved a similar measure .
police de@@ par@@ t@@ ments have stopped charging ad@@ ults 21 years and older for small @-@ scale possession that will be legally san@@ c@@ tioned once the laws take effect in the coming weeks .
but prosecutors in more conservative prec@@ inc@@ ts in Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o have vowed to press ahead with existing mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana cases and are still citing people for possession .
at the same time , several towns from the D@@ en@@ ver su@@ bur@@ bs to the Western mountains are voting to block new , state @-@ licen@@ sed retail mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana shops from opening in their communities .
&quot; this thing is evol@@ ving so quickly that I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen next , &quot; said Daniel J@@ . O@@ ates , the police chief in A@@ ur@@ ora , just east of D@@ en@@ ver .
re@@ gu@@ la@@ tors in Washington State are also scr@@ at@@ ching their heads .
and they are looking for gu@@ id@@ ance on how to set up a system of licenses for production , manufacturing , distribution and sales - all by a deadline of Dec@@ . 1 , 2013 .
they say that Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o , for better or worse , is ahead of most states in re@@ gu@@ la@@ ting mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana , first for medical use and now rec@@ re@@ ation@@ ally .
&quot; Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o has a more regulated market , so they will be a good guide , &quot; said Bri@@ an E@@ . S@@ mit@@ h , a spokesman for the Washington State liqu@@ or Control Board .
but no place or system , Mr. S@@ mit@@ h conce@@ ded , can do more than suggest what might work .
&quot; there &apos;s no real precedent for us to follow , &quot; he said .
Washington &apos;s law , called I @-@ 5@@ 02 , takes effect on Dec@@ . 6 , which also leaves a year of li@@ m@@ bo during which the state licen@@ sing system will not yet exist , but leg@@ al@@ ized possession will .
and there are thor@@ ny me@@ chan@@ ical questions that must be resolved during that time , like how to balance the state &apos;s mandate of &quot; adequate access &quot; to licen@@ sed mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana with its prohibi@@ tions on can@@ na@@ bis businesses within 1,000 fe@@ et of a school , park , play@@ ground or child care cen@@ ter .
&quot; no@@ where will it be more difficult to site a licen@@ sed can@@ na@@ bis business than in urban areas , particularly in the Se@@ at@@ t@@ le me@@ tro@@ pol@@ it@@ an area , &quot; said B@@ en Li@@ v@@ ing@@ st@@ on , a spokesman for the Center for Leg@@ al can@@ na@@ bis , a recently formed research group .
on Nov@@ . 21 , Chief O@@ ates in A@@ ur@@ ora sent his officers an e @-@ mail announcing that the city attorney would no longer be pros@@ ec@@ ut@@ ing small mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana violations for anyone 21 years or older , and that the police would stop charging people for those crimes &quot; effective immediately . &quot;
chief O@@ ates said that the police would enforce city co@@ des re@@ gu@@ la@@ ting medical mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana gro@@ w@@ ers , and that they would still pursue drug traffickers and deal@@ ers .
in northern Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o &apos;s W@@ el@@ d County , the district attorney , K@@ en bu@@ ck , represents a stri@@ c@@ ter view .
after the vote , he said his office would continue pursuing mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana possession cases , mostly as a way to press users into getting treatment .
right now , 1@@ 19 people face charges of pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ing two oun@@ ces or less of mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana , though many are facing other charges .
&quot; our office has an obligation to prosecute offen@@ ses that were crimes at the time they occurred , &quot; Mr. bu@@ ck said in a statement .
the response has been complicated even in places like rural Mes@@ a County , where voters rejected the mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana initiative .
the police in Grand jun@@ ction , the county &apos;s largest city , are no longer citing ad@@ ults for possession of small amounts .
the county &apos;s district attorney , Pet@@ e H@@ aut@@ z@@ ing@@ er , supported that decision , but also decided not to dismis@@ s all of the pending possession cases .
&quot; I do not think I &apos;m was@@ ting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes , &quot; he said .
although 55 percent of Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o voters supported the measure , bringing rec@@ re@@ ational mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana into the fol@@ ds of government and the legal system was never going to be simple .
and the contradi@@ c@@ tory reactions across the state lay b@@ are a deep ambi@@ val@@ ence among local officials about the state &apos;s big green experim@@ ent .
&quot; it &apos;s a cultural bar@@ ri@@ er &quot; with district at@@ t@@ or@@ ne@@ ys , said S@@ ean Mc@@ Al@@ l@@ is@@ ter , a D@@ en@@ ver lawyer who represents mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana defendants and is a local spokesman for the National Organ@@ ization for the Reform of mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana La@@ ws .
&quot; they spent so much of their lives pros@@ ec@@ ut@@ ing people that they still don &apos;t really accept that this is legal , &quot; he said .
as the first states to treat small amounts of mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana like alcohol , Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o and Washington are poised to become national test cases for drug leg@@ al@@ ization .
as advocates and state officials plan for a new fron@@ ti@@ er of leg@@ al@@ ized sales , they are also an@@ x@@ i@@ ously awaiting direction from the federal government , which still plans to treat the sale and cultiv@@ ation of mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana as federal crimes .
advocates for leg@@ al@@ ized mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana are hoping the Justice Department yi@@ el@@ ds .
despite some high @-@ profile arrests of medical mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana patients and sel@@ lers , the federal government has mostly allowed medical mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana businesses to operate in Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o , Washington and 16 other states .
while drug agents will probably not beat down doors to se@@ ize a small ba@@ g of the drug , they are likely to bal@@ k at allowing the state @-@ regulated rec@@ re@@ ational mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana shops allowed under the new laws , said K@@ ev@@ in A@@ . Sab@@ et , a former drug policy adviser in the Obama administration .
several cities in Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o are not waiting for federal authorities to act .
even before Election Day , some local governments approved mor@@ at@@ ori@@ ums on any new mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana shops , even though it will be about a year before any can open .
last week , the western city of Mon@@ tr@@ ose took up a six @-@ month ban , and is likely to pass it next week .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to be put in a position where we license so@@ me@@ body and then have a big federal issue , &quot; said Bo@@ b Nic@@ hol@@ son , a City Council member .
our community voted against this amendment .
we &apos;re looking at what the community voted for ver@@ su@@ s what the state voted for .
there &apos;s an aw@@ ful lot of questions .
Pet@@ r@@ on@@ el@@ la W@@ y@@ at@@ t : I was bul@@ lied out of O@@ x@@ for@@ d for being a T@@ ory
it is not just today &apos;s university students who are attacked for their views
I can &apos;t remember a time when I didn &apos;t dream of winning a place at O@@ x@@ for@@ d University .
both my father and my el@@ der brother had been at what I ima@@ gin@@ ed was the world &apos;s greatest seat of learning , a modern @-@ day wine @-@ b@@ l@@ us@@ hed Greek sy@@ m@@ pos@@ ium encouraging the dual pil@@ lar@@ s of civilisation , free thinking and tolerance .
yet , within two weeks of taking up my place at Wor@@ ces@@ ter Col@@ le@@ ge in the late e@@ igh@@ ties to read history , I &apos;d packed my bags , pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ating the first scandal of my life .
my father broke down and cri@@ ed .
friends were b@@ aff@@ led .
the E@@ ven@@ ing Standard di@@ ary claimed I &apos;d quit because I ob@@ j@@ ected to fellow under@@ gra@@ du@@ ates having sex in the room next to mine .
the writer A N W@@ il@@ son announced w@@ ag@@ g@@ ish@@ ly that I &apos;d de@@ par@@ ted because I was forced to dr@@ ink out of chi@@ pped m@@ ug@@ s .
the truth was less d@@ r@@ ol@@ l .
I ran away .
yes , ran , because I had been subject to systematic bul@@ lying and intimidation .
not on account of my rather ou@@ tr@@ Ã© name , or the fact that I came from a private school .
I was per@@ sec@@ u@@ ted for one reason only , and in this c@@ ra@@ d@@ le of supposed en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment it was both bi@@ go@@ ted and bar@@ bar@@ ic : my father , the late W@@ o@@ od@@ row W@@ y@@ at@@ t , was a high @-@ profile adviser to Mar@@ gar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher and I was a Con@@ ser@@ v@@ ative supporter .
why bring this up now , you might ask .
well , recent reports suggest that a new generation of R@@ ight @-@ of @-@ centre students are suffering a similar persecution .
such is the institu@@ tion@@ alised and increasing hatred of T@@ ory students at O@@ x@@ for@@ d that last week a group of them demanded the same equal @-@ rights protection as g@@ ays , disabled people and ethnic minorities .
conservative members of Cor@@ p@@ us Christ@@ i Col@@ le@@ ge &apos;s junior common room ( J@@ C@@ R ) claim they are &quot; often actively isolated , personally attacked and made to feel un@@ welcome &quot; because of their political views .
they want to create a post on the col@@ le@@ ge &apos;s equal opportunities committee to ensure that their opinions can be aired freely .
their situation wasn &apos;t helped by a recent BBC T@@ w@@ o documentary , W@@ on@@ der@@ land : young , b@@ right and on the R@@ ight , about student politics , which por@@ tr@@ ay@@ ed T@@ or@@ ies as od@@ d@@ bal@@ ls and ne@@ o @-@ N@@ az@@ is .
it featured graduate Jo@@ e Co@@ oke , former president of the O@@ x@@ for@@ d University Con@@ ser@@ v@@ ative Association ( O@@ U@@ C@@ A ) , travelling in a r@@ ol@@ ls @-@ R@@ oy@@ ce , s@@ por@@ ting a silver suit and silver @-@ top@@ ped can@@ e .
at other universities , Con@@ ser@@ v@@ ative students say they are being treated as &quot; s@@ cap@@ e@@ go@@ ats &quot; for the introduction of higher tu@@ ition fees . &quot;
L@@ uk@@ e Black , 20 , vice @-@ president of N@@ ot@@ t@@ ing@@ ham University Con@@ ser@@ v@@ ative Association , told a Sunday newspaper that &quot; there is a growing Lef@@ t @-@ wing bi@@ as at universities .
people assume we are like the Bul@@ l@@ ing@@ don Club without meeting us . &quot;
Sam@@ u@@ el Ro@@ ber@@ ts , 21 , a history student at Cor@@ p@@ us Christ@@ i , who proposed the motion for greater protection , says such a climate is &quot; un@@ comfortable , &quot; while Ste@@ p@@ han@@ ie Cher@@ ill , 19 , president elect of O@@ U@@ C@@ A , says there has been a de@@ ter@@ i@@ oration in the attitude of J@@ C@@ R members towards people who are R@@ ight of centre .
&quot; this poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion , as well as to the welfare of members , &quot; she says .
I was in a minority of one during my first few weeks at O@@ x@@ for@@ d .
I had gone up in September 19@@ 8@@ 6 , a cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ingly sh@@ y 18 @-@ year @-@ old .
hatred of the Con@@ ser@@ v@@ ative Party was at its most fe@@ br@@ ile .
the year before , the university had voted to refuse Mar@@ gar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher - a former student - an hon@@ or@@ ary degree , because of cuts in higher education funding .
the atmosphere would have made a S@@ tal@@ in@@ ist sh@@ u@@ d@@ der with ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion .
during the first few days of f@@ res@@ h@@ ers &quot; week , when new students soci@@ alise with each other and the d@@ ons , I had a tas@@ te of the wor@@ m@@ wood that was to come .
I was to find that the d@@ ons not only con@@ ni@@ ved in the ta@@ un@@ ting of T@@ ory under@@ gra@@ du@@ ates but took part with re@@ l@@ ish .
the politics of the miners &quot; strike , privatisation and the government &apos;s opposition to sanctions against ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id South Africa were brought into the wood @-@ pan@@ elled rooms of the t@@ ut@@ orial .
my first one involved transla@@ ting 18th @-@ century French tex@@ ts into English , and I was un@@ prepared for what followed .
&quot; Miss W@@ y@@ at@@ t , &quot; said the don , Har@@ ry P@@ it@@ t ( now de@@ ce@@ ased ) , &quot; ple@@ ase trans@@ late the first par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h . &quot;
I st@@ um@@ b@@ led over it .
a small man with a face like c@@ ake bat@@ ter , P@@ it@@ t was big on b@@ ile .
&quot; do T@@ hat@@ ch@@ er@@ ites refuse to learn French or are they just st@@ up@@ id ? &quot; he demanded .
the other under@@ gra@@ du@@ ates gi@@ g@@ g@@ led .
te@@ ars pri@@ cked the back of my eyes .
&quot; I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spar@@ e time - that is , if you &apos;re not too busy soci@@ alising , &quot; P@@ it@@ t s@@ n@@ ar@@ led .
I w@@ al@@ k@@ ed back to my rooms a dis@@ con@@ so@@ late figure .
at din@@ ner in col@@ le@@ ge that evening I sat by myself ; then I felt a light ta@@ p on my sho@@ ul@@ der .
it was a second @-@ year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the O@@ U@@ C@@ A .
&quot; I know who you are , &quot; he said kin@@ dly .
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s like that .
anyone suspected of being a T@@ ory is pic@@ ked on .
it &apos;s bad enough for me , but they know your father is close to Mar@@ gar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher , so it will be worse for you .
most T@@ ory f@@ res@@ h@@ ers pre@@ tend they &apos;re Labour .
later , at a local pu@@ b , I c@@ ra@@ ven@@ ly attempted to dis@@ si@@ mu@@ late .
I insisted that I didn &apos;t agree with everything M@@ r@@ s T@@ hat@@ cher said .
this p@@ lo@@ y proved un@@ successful .
a first year P@@ P@@ E student , who , ir@@ on@@ ically , had been to E@@ ton , said : &quot; you &apos;re the daughter of a fas@@ c@@ ist pi@@ g . &quot;
you &apos;re con@@ t@@ am@@ inated .
other students took up the refrain .
I was per@@ ver@@ ted , dir@@ ty .
&quot; how do T@@ or@@ ies have sex ? &quot; one asked .
they beat each other , don &apos;t they ?
I felt the way h@@ om@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ als must have felt before the liberal legislation of the six@@ ties .
would I ever be able to lead a normal life at O@@ x@@ for@@ d ?
would I be forced to meet like @-@ min@@ ded people only after dark ?
would I have to turn to Labour and sup@@ press my natural inc@@ lin@@ ations ?
the three years before me st@@ re@@ t@@ ched out as a pur@@ g@@ atory of os@@ trac@@ ism and isolation .
the only openly T@@ ory don was N@@ or@@ man St@@ one , Professor of Mo@@ der@@ n H@@ ist@@ ory , who was based at my col@@ le@@ ge .
he was ha@@ ted for being not only a Con@@ ser@@ v@@ ative but a foreign policy adviser to T@@ hat@@ cher and one of her speech writers .
he was hardly ever there .
he lo@@ ath@@ ed the place as prov@@ in@@ cial and p@@ et@@ ty , and for its ad@@ her@@ ence to the Mar@@ x@@ ist @-@ de@@ ter@@ min@@ ist view of history .
in 1997 he took up a pro@@ f@@ es@@ sor@@ ship at the University of Bil@@ k@@ ent , in Ankara , Turkey .
&quot; you won &apos;t be happy here , &quot; he told me .
I began com@@ m@@ ut@@ ing from O@@ x@@ for@@ d to my parents &quot; house in London , finding ref@@ uge with my more open @-@ min@@ ded me@@ tro@@ pol@@ it@@ an friends and family .
I told my father I ha@@ ted O@@ x@@ for@@ d and why .
he was inc@@ re@@ d@@ ul@@ ous .
during his time there in the for@@ ties , all political views had been accepted .
&quot; but it &apos;s the best place in the world , &quot; he said pa@@ the@@ tically .
they wouldn &apos;t do that , not among my dre@@ am@@ ing sp@@ i@@ res .
even my Communist friends always had im@@ p@@ ec@@ cable man@@ ners .
his r@@ he@@ um@@ y eyes began to cl@@ oud .
give it a chance .
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s all just a te@@ ase .
it would break my heart if you left .
exha@@ usted by my frequent tri@@ ps to London , my emo@@ tional resistance was de@@ ter@@ i@@ or@@ ating .
a male friend of mine , also a T@@ ory supporter , had suc@@ cum@@ bed to pressure and ren@@ oun@@ ced his cre@@ ed .
during a t@@ ut@@ orial the following week , when another history don had suggested , in complete ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ness , that I was an &quot; en@@ em@@ y of the people , &quot; I decided to do the same .
In@@ war@@ dly b@@ l@@ us@@ hing with sha@@ me , I admitted to being &quot; bra@@ in@@ was@@ hed by my parents &quot; and called them &quot; old fo@@ ols . &quot;
the res@@ p@@ ite was short .
it was my father who dro@@ ve the na@@ il into the co@@ ff@@ in of my O@@ x@@ for@@ d career .
at the time , he wrote two col@@ um@@ ns in the Mur@@ do@@ ch press each week .
my door was locked .
I co@@ w@@ ered inside , and after five minutes , my pursu@@ ers gave up .
when they left , I packed a su@@ it@@ case and caught the first train to London .
I never went back .
you may call me a s@@ ni@@ v@@ elling w@@ im@@ p .
but no 18 @-@ year @-@ old should be subject to such intimidation and v@@ it@@ ri@@ ol in an educational institution .
even more tra@@ gic is that it was O@@ x@@ for@@ d , which not only produced 14 T@@ ory prime ministers , but , to this day , hi@@ des behind an ill @-@ de@@ served reputation for equality and freedom of thought .
two people dro@@ w@@ ned in floods in Tra@@ b@@ z@@ on
the I@@ k@@ is@@ u cre@@ ek over@@ f@@ lo@@ w@@ ed on account of heavy ra@@ inf@@ all in the district of Y@@ om@@ ra in Tra@@ b@@ z@@ on .
two women disappeared in the flo@@ od@@ waters in the village of T@@ as@@ de@@ len and the road to the village of S@@ ay@@ van was closed .
the body of one of the women dro@@ w@@ ned in the floods was found .
there was pre@@ cip@@ itation in the hi@@ gh@@ lands of Y@@ om@@ ra at around 15 : 0@@ 0 .
when the I@@ k@@ is@@ u cre@@ ek over@@ f@@ lo@@ w@@ ed , a section almost 200 meters of the road connecting I@@ k@@ is@@ u to S@@ ay@@ van was flo@@ o@@ ded .
one of the village &apos;s residents , Ibrahim Kar@@ s@@ l@@ Ä± , said that work on opening the road had not started despite the authorities being al@@ er@@ ted . &quot; the road has been closed for 3 hours .
we experience the same after every heavy ra@@ inf@@ all .
we have al@@ er@@ ted the authorities but no one has come so far .
the local residents are unhappy .
we en@@ dur@@ e this hard@@ ship every year .
when the trees block the cre@@ ek , the water reac@@ hes up to the road , &quot; he said .
one person &apos;@@ S body was found
the mayor of Y@@ om@@ ra , Ibrahim S@@ a@@ Ä@@ Ä±@@ ro@@ Ä@@ l@@ u , reported that the body of one of the women who dro@@ w@@ ned in the floods after heavy ra@@ inf@@ all in the district has been found , the search for the other person was being continued .
S@@ a@@ Ä@@ Ä±@@ ro@@ Ä@@ l@@ u reminded that two women collecting n@@ u@@ ts in the village of T@@ a@@ Å@@ de@@ len village were was@@ hed away in the flo@@ od@@ waters caused by y@@ es@@ ter@@ day &apos;s tor@@ ren@@ ti@@ al ra@@ ins in the district .
S@@ a@@ Ä@@ Ä±@@ ro@@ Ä@@ l@@ u said that the search was conducted until late in the night and started again early in the morning : &quot; thanks to the ma@@ ch@@ in@@ ery and work by the municipal cor@@ por@@ ation , the body of one of our fellow coun@@ tr@@ y@@ men has been found , the search is being continued for the other , &quot; he said .
S@@ a@@ Ä@@ Ä±@@ ro@@ Ä@@ l@@ u added that the impact of the ra@@ inf@@ all has dimin@@ ished , the weather has become more sun@@ ny , and the search for the missing person and the work on closed roads were pro@@ g@@ res@@ sing easily .
he said that while the search for the missing women was in progress , the road to T@@ as@@ de@@ len village is now open to traffic .
&quot; it would B@@ E lev@@ elled T@@ O the ground &quot;
the residents of T@@ as@@ de@@ len in the district of Y@@ om@@ ra are trying to reconc@@ ile themselves to the loss and damage caused by the tor@@ ren@@ ti@@ al floods and land@@ sli@@ de .
Der@@ ya , a resident of T@@ as@@ de@@ len said that the ra@@ inf@@ all continued for about three hours un@@ inter@@ rup@@ te@@ d@@ ly and said &quot; It was not a ra@@ inf@@ all , but a natural disaster . &quot;
T@@ a@@ Å@@ kar@@ a said that many people evacu@@ ated their homes f@@ ear@@ ing a land@@ sli@@ de during the tor@@ ren@@ ti@@ al ra@@ ins ; &quot; We stopped collecting n@@ u@@ ts .
that is when such a disaster struck .
the bri@@ de and her mother @-@ in @-@ law were collecting n@@ u@@ ts during the flood .
they were tr@@ apped in a land@@ sli@@ de on their way home , &quot; he said .
T@@ a@@ Å@@ kar@@ a added that supply of electricity and water to the village had been dis@@ rup@@ ted .
Hasan Se@@ li@@ m said that in 60 years of his life , he had never seen such tor@@ ren@@ ti@@ al ra@@ ins and added , &quot; I@@ f the ra@@ ins had continued for an hour longer , everything there would have been f@@ lat@@ tened . &quot;

who is considered disabled and how do you receive a pension
valuable H@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ ri@@ yet readers : from now on , I will try to solve problems in your professional lives and social security issues and to discuss anything that you are cur@@ ious about and share my experiences with you .
de@@ ar readers , you come across hundreds of news stories about social security and professional life in both the print and electronic media .
from now on , I will present you with the most ac@@ cur@@ ate , credible and reliable news in the H@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ ri@@ yet newspaper and on hur@@ ri@@ y@@ et@@ .@@ com@@ .@@ tr@@ .
first , I want to take a look at the dis@@ ability d@@ os@@ si@@ er , which has had a great impact on the public .
we will deal with this d@@ os@@ si@@ er in various stages in the form of a series of articles .
you can find answers to all questions on dis@@ ability outlined in our articles .
you can send in your qu@@ eries that are of specific interest to you to which you cannot find answers at al@@ ip@@ ek@@ ten @ hur@@ ri@@ y@@ et@@ .@@ com@@ .@@ tr@@ .
I will put in all efforts to respond to you as soon as possible .
what is retirement due to dis@@ ability ?
retirement due to dis@@ ability means that , regardless of age , if those in@@ sured with S@@ S@@ K or Ba@@ Ä @-@ K@@ ur lose at least 60 % of their working ability and become dy@@ s@@ functional , to sustain their lives and provided that they meet the insurance requirements as sti@@ p@@ ulated by the S@@ G@@ K legislation , they are given option of early retirement .
public servants , apart from the above @-@ mentioned , may be given early retirement if they lose their occup@@ ational ear@@ ning power to the extent that they cannot perform their duties .
who are considered disabled ?
I am writing from Diyarbakir , my name is Mehmet G@@ Ã¼@@ l@@ te@@ k@@ in and I have 9@@ 20 days of insurance with an additional 5@@ 40 days credit from my military service making up a total of 1,@@ 4@@ 60 days of insurance premi@@ um paid in all .
also , I have ren@@ al disease .
I am undergoing di@@ al@@ y@@ sis treatment .
I am currently employed .
am I entitled to get dis@@ ability pension ?
Mehmet , first of all , ple@@ ase get well soon .
among the circumstances you have indicated in your qu@@ ery , you have not indicated when you first started work .
however , let me tell you how you could be entitled to a dis@@ ability pension .
first , the most important requirement speci@@ fied by law is that you must be in@@ sured for 10 years and must have paid insurance premi@@ um for a total of 1,800 days .
moreover , you are deemed disabled when it is diagnos@@ ed by the S@@ G@@ K Health Council that you have lost at least 60 % of your working ability caused by work @-@ related accident or an occup@@ ational disease .
however , you meet the 60 % requirement by being a di@@ al@@ y@@ sis patient , but you are not entitled to pension because you did not complete payment of premi@@ um for 1,800 days .
of course , we do not know how long you have been working .
you will be granted pension if you apply to the S@@ G@@ K on the day you re@@ lin@@ qu@@ ish work when you complete 10 years and premi@@ um payment for 1,800 days .
conditions for enti@@ t@@ le@@ ment to dis@@ ability pension
can a person re@@ tir@@ e without meeting the criteria of 10 years and premi@@ um payment for 1,800 days required for enti@@ t@@ le@@ ment to pension ?
- Y@@ ou must complete payment of premi@@ um for 1,800 days .
there is only one exception : for those for whom it has been decided that they are in need of constant nur@@ sing and care by someone else , they may be entitled to dis@@ ability pension without the 10 @-@ year requirement as long as they meet the other conditions .
we will talk about the ill@@ n@@ esses or conditions that are considered in determining the dependence on constant care later in the article .
the status of those who are disabled before starting work
I am Ahmet G@@ Ã¼@@ ler .
I was told that I am not entitled to dis@@ ability pension even though I met all the requirements in the S@@ G@@ K law since I was disabled before I started working .
I have been treated un@@ j@@ ust@@ ly .
is this not unfair ?
how can I re@@ tir@@ e ?
- Ahmet , you have written that you meet all the requirements of the law but one of the main requirements of the law is that those in@@ sured with S@@ S@@ K and Ba@@ Ä @-@ K@@ ur should not have been suffering from any ill@@ n@@ esses that prevent you from working before you even start working .
dis@@ ability pension cannot be granted to you since you do not meet this cr@@ it@@ er@@ ion .
however , you can re@@ tir@@ e when you meet all the conditions for receiving an old @-@ age pension .
- I have 3@@ 9@@ 80 days and I am in@@ sured for 16 years .
the S@@ G@@ K has diagnos@@ ed that my dis@@ ability commen@@ ced before I started work .
they said I could not re@@ tir@@ e on grounds of dis@@ ability .
in this case , what can I do ?
will I not be able to re@@ tir@@ e ?
can you show me a way ?
- Y@@ es , you heard right .
you cannot re@@ tir@@ e on account of dis@@ ability .
but in the S@@ G@@ K legislation , there is a retirement option for you too .
in other words , there are two situations : before October 2008 and after October 2008 .
if you first started working before that date , and in case S@@ G@@ K establis@@ hes that you were disabled before starting work , you may be granted partial old @-@ age pension with the condition of having been in@@ sured for at least 15 years and having paid insurance premi@@ um for 3,@@ 600 days .
for this reason , we recommend that you contact your ne@@ ar@@ est S@@ G@@ K Directorate and apply for pension .
- B@@ ut if you started work after October 2008 , you may be granted old @-@ age pension on the condition that you were in@@ sured for at least fif@@ teen years and have paid at least 3,@@ 9@@ 60 days of premi@@ um for dis@@ ability , old age and life insurance .
do I have to quit work in order to apply ?
at present , I am employed as a driver .
I was diagnos@@ ed with cancer when I visited the hospital .
I want to re@@ tir@@ e on grounds of dis@@ ability .
in this case , do I have to quit work ?
can I apply for pension without qu@@ it@@ ting work ?
I do not want to be out of work until pension is granted .
- Y@@ ou heard right .
to submit your pension request , you must quit work .
however , before applying for pension , you must be diagnos@@ ed as being disabled according to the S@@ G@@ K law .
however , if you are disabled you are granted pension with the other conditions .
there is no point in making an application for pension before being diagnos@@ ed as being disabled , but there is a risk of being unemployed .
for this , it is enough that you have 1,800 days .
when you submit your application to the S@@ G@@ K to di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose your dis@@ ability , the S@@ G@@ K will direct you to an author@@ ized hospital .
when you submit the health council report ( concerning your cancer diagnos@@ is ) to the S@@ G@@ K , the latter will evaluate it by its own health council and if they decide that because of the cancer you have lost more than 60 % of your working ability , then this will be the reason for your pension application .
however , to be granted pension you must complete 10 years of payment of premi@@ um to the insurance company , and if you have completed this period you will be granted pension .
in other words , we can say bri@@ ef@@ ly that it is un@@ w@@ ise for those employed and in@@ sured to make applications without the decision of the S@@ G@@ K health council that they are disabled .
but every unemployed in@@ sured , if they meet all the conditions , can request the diagnos@@ is of dis@@ ability status and pension from the S@@ G@@ K at the same time .
this may be hel@@ p@@ ful in order to get pension granted at a somewhat earlier date if they are disabled and meet all the other requirements .
can a Ba@@ Ä @-@ K@@ ur deb@@ tor re@@ tir@@ e on account of dis@@ ability ?
I am in@@ sured by Ba@@ Ä @-@ K@@ ur .
I meet all the conditions .
however , they said that I could not re@@ tir@@ e since I have a debt .
what should I do ?
- De@@ ar re@@ ader ,
who@@ ever told you that is correct .
you did not write what the other conditions are , but if you think that you meet those conditions , it is a legal requirement that you must pay your 4 / b premi@@ um debt .
but I can give you special advice .
since you will be granted pension , I suggest that you re@@ pay your debt by involving the banks or similar institutions .
the earlier you are granted pension , the more you will be paid , and you will be able to re@@ pay your debt .
it will be easy to get credit since these institutions will de@@ duc@@ t the re@@ payment instal@@ l@@ ments from your pension .
what is the basis for granting the dis@@ ability pension ?
I worked in accordance with the S@@ S@@ K , Ba@@ Ä @-@ K@@ ur and retirement F@@ unds .
when am I entitled to a pension and which institution will grant me the pension ?
- De@@ ar re@@ ader , if you have worked with more than one status - as Ba@@ Ä @-@ K@@ ur , S@@ G@@ K or a civil ser@@ van@@ t - your dis@@ ability pension will be granted by the very last insurance status . in other words , if your last position was in@@ sured by S@@ G@@ K , you will be paid by S@@ G@@ K if you resign from work and meet all the other conditions .
hospital reports that are valid at the S@@ G@@ K
how do I apply for dis@@ ability ?
which are the hospitals from where I can get a health report ?
for health council reports , it is sufficient to apply to the prov@@ in@@ cial social security direc@@ tor@@ ates or social security centres .
the S@@ G@@ K will ask you to visit an educational and research hospital associated with the Ministry of Health , a University hospital ( exclu@@ ding private university and foundation hospitals ) or a military hospital of the Turkish Armed Forces .
however , if those hospitals are not present in the province where you live , you may be sent to a fully established hospital run by the Ministry of Health .
can I be sent to a private hospital ?
- It is possible , but there are conditions app@@ lic@@ able .
according to the former legislation , only those patients in state hospital intensive care units with an emergency risk can be referred to the hospitals where they are , but with the new regulations coming into force with effect from 1 September , 2013 , as long as the hospital has an agreement with the S@@ G@@ K , intensive care patients with an emergency risk can be referred to the hospital where they are even if this hospital is private and the health council reports of those hospitals will also be valid .
what are the requirements for an operation pres@@ cri@@ bed by refer@@ r@@ al ?
to carry out refer@@ r@@ al operations that di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the dis@@ ability status of the in@@ sured , it is sufficient to have paid the premi@@ um for 1,800 days .
hospital expenses related to establishing the dis@@ ability status are paid by the S@@ G@@ K .
moreover , the 10 @-@ year insurance period is not required . what the S@@ G@@ K looks for is this :
in case of a dis@@ ability pension grant , if the person is in need of care , only 1,800 days will be sufficient without the 10 @-@ year requirement and the pension is granted on the basis of the health council report .
for this reason , when the person requests diagnos@@ is of his or her dis@@ ability for the first time , the S@@ G@@ K checks only the 1,800 day requirement in case of a dis@@ ability that needs nur@@ sing care .
N@@ ar@@ gh@@ ile operation
the police have begun to check the ban@@ s introduced in N@@ ar@@ gh@@ ile cafes .
many shops and establis@@ hments had to stop selling n@@ ar@@ gh@@ ile after inspec@@ tions were carried out over the weekend .
the police began to or@@ g@@ an@@ ize operations at n@@ ar@@ gh@@ ile cafes in Istanbul in response to new regulations that were being enforced .
N@@ ar@@ gh@@ ile sales were stopped in establis@@ hments without a lic@@ ence after conducting an operation in n@@ ar@@ gh@@ ile cafes in the B@@ e@@ Å@@ ik@@ ta@@ Å area .
while almost all n@@ ar@@ gh@@ ile cafes were affected by the raids , penalties shall be imposed on cafes that continue to sell n@@ ar@@ gh@@ ile .
shops and establis@@ hments that continue selling shall be shut down .
sales have been banned
the T@@ ob@@ ac@@ co and Al@@ co@@ ho@@ l Market Re@@ gu@@ la@@ tory Authority ( TA@@ PDK ) published the &quot; Re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions on the Is@@ sue of con@@ for@@ m@@ ity certi@@ fic@@ ates to the A@@ re@@ a ( s ) of N@@ ar@@ gh@@ ile T@@ ob@@ ac@@ co Pro@@ duc@@ t S@@ m@@ oking shops and establis@@ hments and the Re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments to be met in order to operate such Pla@@ ces &quot; last February .
a noti@@ fication was issued granting a five @-@ month period to move n@@ ar@@ gh@@ ile cafes at least 200 meters away from schools .
it is also prohibited to smoke n@@ ar@@ gh@@ ile in public in@@ door venues .
the first set of raids against shops and establis@@ hments not comp@@ lying with the noti@@ fication commen@@ ced y@@ es@@ ter@@ day in B@@ e@@ Å@@ ik@@ ta@@ Å .
many establis@@ hments without a n@@ ar@@ gh@@ ile lic@@ ence had to dis@@ continue sales , including the most popular n@@ ar@@ gh@@ ile cafes in the ne@@ ig@@ bour@@ ho@@ ods of Istanbul such as Al F@@ aker in Be@@ be@@ k , Ä°@@ k@@ ra@@ m N@@ ar@@ gh@@ ile in I@@ h@@ la@@ mu@@ r Kas@@ ri and M@@ is N@@ ar@@ gh@@ ile C@@ af@@ e in the B@@ e@@ Å@@ ik@@ ta@@ Å m@@ ark@@ et@@ place .
fines start from 2@@ 3,000 T@@ L
the police will impose fines starting from 2@@ 3,000 T@@ L if these establis@@ hments without a lic@@ ence continue selling n@@ ar@@ gh@@ ile .
the shops and establis@@ hments that are fined three times will be shut down and sealed .
apparently , there are only five shops and establis@@ hments at present having a valid n@@ ar@@ gh@@ ile caf@@ e license in Istanbul .
warnings were af@@ fixed to bot@@ t@@ les
the TA@@ PDK made it mandatory to put a &apos; warning &apos; h@@ olo@@ gra@@ m on n@@ ar@@ gh@@ ile bot@@ t@@ les with effect from July 27 . in compliance with the noti@@ fication published , the health warnings must be in cy@@ lin@@ dri@@ cal or con@@ ical form according to the form of the bot@@ tle .
warning sti@@ c@@ kers are af@@ fixed to the device starting from the m@@ ou@@ th@@ piece of the bot@@ tle .
sti@@ c@@ kers with health warnings pr@@ in@@ ted in blue , red , y@@ el@@ low and black can be used .
at the moment , such warning sti@@ c@@ kers are af@@ fixed to many cafes .
a critical warning has been issued by the Police to families
the Security General Directorate is warning families about events called &quot; summer camps &quot; and &quot; student camps &quot; by illegal organiz@@ ations in order to recru@@ it fol@@ lo@@ w@@ ers .
teams from the Anti @-@ Ter@@ ror Bran@@ ch Directorate , based on intelligence collected in 17 cities , discovered a new plan by organiz@@ ations that apparently engaged in acts of violence during the Ge@@ zi Park event including the D@@ H@@ K@@ P @-@ C , M@@ L@@ K@@ P , T@@ K@@ P , T@@ K@@ I@@ P and some legal groups .
security forces identified terror organiz@@ ations that were organiz@@ ing camps under the name of &quot; summer camp &quot; and &quot; student camp &quot; for young people to recru@@ it fol@@ lo@@ w@@ ers and warned families not to send their children to these camps .
anti @-@ terror police units established that the organiz@@ ations were planning 41 camps in different prov@@ inc@@ es and met with families to request them not to send their children to these camps .
350 families de@@ ter@@ red from sending their children to camps
anti @-@ terror police established that the organiz@@ ations , especially the D@@ H@@ K@@ P @-@ C , M@@ L@@ K@@ P and T@@ K@@ I@@ P , planned to recru@@ it young people by using their legal ex@@ ten@@ sions and warned the families that they con@@ t@@ acted about the events being organiz@@ ed under the gu@@ ise of camps .
350 families followed the advice given by the Police and decided not to send their children to the camps .
after the police warnings , 14 of 41 planned camps were cancelled .
the organiz@@ ations held 20 camps despite the reduced level of attendance .
security forces indicated that two camps are still in progress and five others are scheduled to be held in the days to come .
the Security General Directorate also sent warning letters regarding the camps to the relevant security organiz@@ ations in all the prov@@ inc@@ es .
young people are being tr@@ apped
it was discovered that 20 terror organiz@@ ation &apos;s camps were organiz@@ ed in Izmir , Ko@@ ca@@ eli , Bal@@ Ä±@@ k@@ es@@ ir , Ã@@ an@@ ak@@ k@@ al@@ e , Ni@@ Ä@@ de , Es@@ k@@ i@@ Å@@ e@@ hi@@ r , Bur@@ sa , B@@ art@@ Ä±@@ n , Ar@@ t@@ v@@ in , Mer@@ s@@ in and H@@ at@@ ay , while those cancelled were in Or@@ d@@ u , Sam@@ sun , Tra@@ b@@ z@@ on , B@@ art@@ Ä±@@ n , Izmir , B@@ ol@@ u and Ad@@ ana .
according to security reports , most of those attending the camps were students who joined the University recently .
illegal organiz@@ ations are tr@@ apping and recru@@ iting young people with the propaganda spread in the camps .
at the camps , new recru@@ its are trained to enhance lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty to the organiz@@ ation .
in these camps , under the mas@@ k of &quot; summer camps , &quot; training on such questions as &quot; how to con@@ ver@@ t actions into violence &quot; was also im@@ par@@ ted along with organiz@@ ational training .
message revealed after half a century
a message in a bot@@ tle thrown into the Atlantic O@@ c@@ ean 50 years ago by a child called D@@ en@@ n@@ is Kom@@ sa was found by someone in the state of New J@@ er@@ se@@ y , U@@ SA .
the glass bot@@ tle was found in deb@@ ri@@ s around a house after H@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e S@@ and@@ y struck last year in the U@@ SA .
the message read : &quot; to the person concerned , ple@@ ase answer the questions given below and send them to the following address .
this is a scientific study being conducted by D@@ en@@ n@@ is Kom@@ sa ( 12 ) . &quot;
the message requested that the fin@@ der of the bot@@ tle to rep@@ lies about where , when and how they found it .
in the bot@@ tle , there was also an en@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ e and small change for the pos@@ t@@ age .
the bot@@ tle was found about 35 kil@@ o@@ me@@ ters from where it was thrown into the oc@@ ean on the coast off New J@@ er@@ se@@ y , dated 16 August 19@@ 63 , and was recently returned to its owner .
Kom@@ sa , who was 12 years old in 19@@ 63 , said he was surprised to see the bot@@ tle he threw into the oc@@ ean almost half a century earlier , and said : &quot; I threw it to the water thinking that someone would find it . but I never thought that it would get back to me . &quot;
audi@@ o f@@ re@@ qu@@ encies can make you fall in love
I was so surprised when one of Turkey &apos;s first audi@@ o en@@ gin@@ e@@ ers , S@@ Ã¼@@ den P@@ am@@ ir , said what could be done with audi@@ o f@@ re@@ qu@@ encies .
when you talk of sound technologies or sound engineering , I believe that almost every one immediately thinks of sound systems related to music .
but did you know that sound technologies could prevent acts of terrorism , commit the per@@ f@@ ect murder with an audi@@ o f@@ re@@ qu@@ ency point pul@@ se , make anyone you wish to fall in love with you , make someone confes@@ s a secret or could help you har@@ mon@@ ize with the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the world ?
after gra@@ du@@ ating from the Department of Interior Des@@ ign at Bil@@ k@@ ent University , S@@ Ã¼@@ den P@@ am@@ ir took a degree in audi@@ o engineering from SA@@ E Col@@ le@@ ge in the UK and completed his M@@ as@@ ter &apos;s on audi@@ o technologies at M@@ id@@ d@@ le@@ sex University .
he now trains audi@@ o en@@ gin@@ e@@ ers at the Com@@ m@@ un@@ ic@@ ation Technology Music Academy I@@ T@@ M , which he founded in Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay , B@@ ey@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u , and te@@ ach@@ es subjects such as music technology , audi@@ o technology , performance technologies , electronic music and advance rec@@ or@@ ding te@@ ch@@ ni@@ ques .
a sub@@ li@@ min@@ al message to terrorism
&quot; what is sound technology exactly ? &quot; was my first question .
&quot; a technology that can be applied to several fields all over the world .
our brain per@@ ce@@ i@@ ves everything with the help of electrical cur@@ ren@@ ts .
sound f@@ re@@ qu@@ ency is also a type of electrical current ; it is energy .
by using this energy , you can change people &apos;s perception or make them move with under the control of your command . , &quot; I got the answer .
one of the important su@@ b @-@ branches of sound technology is sub@@ li@@ min@@ al mes@@ sa@@ ging .
a message can be placed in music or song at a f@@ re@@ qu@@ ency beyond the limits of human perception , which cannot be identified by the con@@ sci@@ ous but it gets registered by the sub@@ con@@ sci@@ ous .
for example , when the threat of a terrorist attack is received , music can be broadcast in that area , according to P@@ am@@ ir .
if in the broadcast song , a message such as &quot; D@@ o not carry out this attack &quot; is placed at a different f@@ re@@ qu@@ ency , the terrorist reg@@ ist@@ ers this message by selec@@ tive perception .
he cannot understand what he he@@ ars but his sub@@ con@@ sci@@ ous per@@ ce@@ i@@ ves it and he feels a voice from inside saying , &quot; D@@ on &apos;t do it . &quot;
he may even per@@ ce@@ ive it as if it were a message from God .
however , this type of sub@@ li@@ min@@ al message is controlled strictly since it constitu@@ tes a public safety risk in Turkey and in the world .
S@@ Ã¼@@ den P@@ am@@ ir only once prepared a sub@@ li@@ min@@ al message during a conference at Istanbul Technical University to explain the subject to students .
&quot; I made the students listen to music during the conference .
I incorpor@@ ated a voice beg@@ ging for water at a certain f@@ re@@ qu@@ ency in the music .
at the end of my presentation , I asked the students if they were thir@@ st@@ y .
sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ingly , they were all very thir@@ st@@ y , &quot; he explained this experim@@ ent .
according to P@@ am@@ ir , sub@@ li@@ min@@ al messages are used illegally and says , &quot; In our country , it has been established that some radio channels in our country did this but the details are unknown .
there is a channel called Radio of the Black Voice in Germany , a f@@ re@@ qu@@ ency used by radical Is@@ lam@@ ists .
it sub@@ li@@ min@@ ally sp@@ reads extremely violent , religious messages calling for j@@ i@@ had and encouraging the use of drugs .
both German and Turkish police are aware of this but they cannot prevent it since the perpetrators keep changing f@@ re@@ qu@@ encies , &quot; he says .
these types of dangerous messages are being used in the music world too .
especially in the songs of some heavy metal groups ...
allegedly , there were no terrorists in the planes that hit the to@@ w@@ ers ; the attacks were made by sub@@ li@@ min@@ al comman@@ ds sent directly to the pilot &apos;s su@@ b @-@ con@@ sci@@ ous mind .
conf@@ id@@ ant T@@ able
audi@@ o technologies can be used for crime as well .
this science is used especially during bank rob@@ ber@@ ies in the U@@ SA .
for example , when the police contact the rob@@ ber on the phone , audi@@ o en@@ gin@@ e@@ ers can determine where , in which room of the bank the person is from the sound of the telephone .
the ech@@ o generated by a sound when it imp@@ in@@ ges on metal , wood , plastic , a wall or any other sur@@ face is different in each case .
depending on the nature of the sound &apos;s ech@@ o , it is possible to determine the size and even the shape of the room he or she is in , and how many cor@@ ners there are .
in this manner , by the criminal &apos;s voice it can be determined , which kind of objects there are and the size and shape of the room he or she is in .
there is a computer pro@@ gra@@ m to do this and P@@ am@@ ir has made dra@@ w@@ ings for an opera building in Tat@@ ar@@ st@@ an with this pro@@ gra@@ m , &quot; I calc@@ ulated the location of 1@@ 75 audi@@ o spe@@ ak@@ ers in the building to achieve a per@@ f@@ ect sound system .
it is not an expensive technology , and costs 4@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 @-@ 5@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 dollars &quot; he says .
audi@@ o f@@ re@@ qu@@ encies are used in architecture and interior design too .
P@@ am@@ ir does a lot of work in this subject .
for example , in a restaurant where businessmen are holding a meeting , a mechanism can be installed to prevent sound waves moving away from the meeting table .
only those at the table can hear what is said at the table .
so@@ me@@ body standing two steps away cannot hear anything said at the table .
the general principle of such mechanisms is as follows : &quot; if you want to destroy a sound , you have to make it clash with another sound at the same f@@ re@@ qu@@ ency , and with the op@@ pos@@ ite of its own mo@@ lec@@ ular structure and can@@ c@@ el the existing sound energy by con@@ ver@@ ting it to heat .
one could never get on a plane if such a system did not exist .
the reason is that the sound of the plane &apos;s en@@ gin@@ es are too l@@ oud to toler@@ ate .
on a plane , these so@@ unds are made to clash with each other to can@@ c@@ el themselves .
with this system you can create a peaceful environment away from the no@@ ise in your home and even if your win@@ do@@ ws are open . &quot;
were the Egyptian P@@ y@@ ra@@ mi@@ ds made by sound ?
there are other interesting works done by P@@ am@@ ir , one of the Turkey &apos;s first audi@@ o en@@ gin@@ e@@ ers .
for example , he developed a mechanism that preven@@ ts the sound of music from being heard outside an open @-@ air dis@@ co in Ay@@ v@@ al@@ Ä±@@ k .
the sound cannot go any further than the bo@@ un@@ d@@ ary ; it clashes with another audi@@ o f@@ re@@ qu@@ ency and gets cancelled .
if desi@@ red , it can be cancelled even beyond a defined line inside a room .
P@@ am@@ ir made a school &apos;s sports arena su@@ itable for both sports and concerts .
it has dual use .
an ech@@ o is required when playing basketball but during a concert there should be no ech@@ o .
it is possible with sound technologies to provide sound quality such that only music can be heard in open @-@ air concerts .
&quot; we can@@ c@@ el unnecessary so@@ unds perceived as no@@ ise , and use f@@ re@@ qu@@ encies that correct human perception and facilitate better perception of music .
M@@ TV is very advanced in this subject .
they held open @-@ air concerts and the sound was like that of a stu@@ dio record in the field , &quot; he explains .
T@@ U@@ B@@ I@@ T@@ A@@ K did such an experim@@ ent too .
separate two plates of al@@ umin@@ um with f@@ re@@ qu@@ encies in the audi@@ o range .
there are scientists who claim that Egyptian P@@ y@@ ra@@ mi@@ ds were made by sound .
they think that the stones could have been be moved and put in place by sound .
&quot; can sound be easily used for mal@@ ic@@ ious purposes ? &quot; I ask .
&quot; I was already very scar@@ ed when I read the studies by the University of York on the Internet since others could read it too .
the reason is that it can lead to un@@ be@@ li@@ ev@@ ably bad consequences if the studies do@@ cum@@ en@@ ted were tried beyond la@@ b conditions even if this were to be done by people in good faith , &quot; he answers .
&quot; pr@@ ay@@ ers are effective in Ara@@ bic &quot;
S@@ Ã¼@@ den P@@ am@@ ir says that no@@ ise pollution can affect people un@@ favour@@ ably and explains , &quot; all so@@ unds that enter the e@@ ars are trans@@ mit@@ ted to the brain .
actually , people hear only those so@@ unds that they focus on , but all the other so@@ unds are also trans@@ mit@@ ted to the brain and it is tir@@ ing .
that is why the brain needs to be cleared ; w@@ al@@ k@@ ing bar@@ ef@@ o@@ o@@ t on the ground and hi@@ king in natural ter@@ rain can help .
in my opinion , mechanisms need to be set up in schools to absor@@ b no@@ ise .
in this way , students can focus entirely on the teacher &apos;s voice and they can maintain their con@@ c@@ entr@@ ation for longer periods of time . &quot;
P@@ am@@ ir says that based on the properties of audi@@ o f@@ re@@ qu@@ encies , pr@@ ay@@ ers are more effective when they are read in Ara@@ bic , and he indicates that Ara@@ bic has a very rich range of audi@@ o f@@ re@@ qu@@ encies and points out that the words are organiz@@ ed in a way to create positive effects when they are read out together .
&quot; but the pr@@ ay@@ ers must be read out l@@ oud . I tre@@ m@@ ble like a f@@ lower when I read the verse of Y@@ as@@ in . &quot; he says .
describing love with f@@ re@@ qu@@ ency
the question that ar@@ ises is whether it is possible to make someone fall in love with audi@@ o f@@ re@@ qu@@ encies .
P@@ am@@ ir so describes the f@@ re@@ qu@@ ency that makes fall in love , or rather , sti@@ mu@@ late one &apos;s fe@@ el@@ ings , by saying , &quot; First , you need to find the dominant f@@ re@@ qu@@ ency that the person you want to fall in love uses when talking .
you can im@@ press him or her by using a higher f@@ re@@ qu@@ ency than this f@@ re@@ qu@@ ency .
for example , let us consider that a person &apos;s dominant f@@ re@@ qu@@ ency is 300 H@@ Z .
and you want to play music to sti@@ mu@@ late his or her fe@@ el@@ ings when you are together .
if you reduce the strength of the single dig@@ it f@@ re@@ qu@@ encies and increase that of the double @-@ dig@@ it f@@ re@@ qu@@ encies of over 300 H@@ Z in the music that you are playing , then the person is more likely to be impressed .
in this way , he or she may even fall in love with the person in front of him or her . &quot;
P@@ am@@ ir talks about special audi@@ o systems in the world for the politicians to deliver their spe@@ ech@@ es im@@ pres@@ sively , and when the bas@@ s f@@ re@@ qu@@ encies are in the fore@@ ground , a politician can be perceived to be a strong one and performing artists can be perceived as a spec@@ tac@@ ular and super@@ natural being .
I ask P@@ am@@ ir : &quot; at the moment in Japan , they are trying to develop a Hor@@ n sound that people believe will be blo@@ wn by Michael on the Day of Res@@ ur@@ rec@@ tion , so what do you think it will be like ? &quot; he says : &quot; I think it will sound close to a human voice because hum@@ ans are most impressed by so@@ unds similar to their own .
for example , the ne@@ y is a spec@@ tac@@ ular instrument , as if it were made of human bre@@ ath . &quot;
gold prices will rise
Dan H@@ r@@ us@@ he@@ w@@ sky , senior G@@ old analyst at Canada J@@ en@@ nings Capital In@@ c , indicated that G@@ over@@ n@@ ments are trying to reduce debt by de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ating the value of cur@@ ren@@ cies , and this is why gold prices would rise above its current level , and said , &quot; G@@ old will continue to be a secure savings com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty . &quot;
the global demand for gold , which was the most profitable av@@ en@@ ue of investment last week , increased in the first half of the year , and H@@ r@@ us@@ he@@ w@@ sky made his ass@@ ess@@ ments based on the price rise observed to the A@@ A correspondent and indicated that investors in China and India appear to support the prices by purchasing gold at lower prices and said , &quot; The demand for gold in China is rising compared to that in India , and Chinese investors are playing a big role in this scenario . &quot;
saying that India is traditionally the biggest pur@@ ch@@ as@@ er of gold , H@@ r@@ us@@ he@@ w@@ sky said , &quot; I believe that the Government is attempting to manage trade accounts by restric@@ ting gold imports but this is not getting much support any further .
people will find a way in this set@@ up , &quot; he explained .
H@@ r@@ us@@ he@@ w@@ sky advised investors to invest in gold in the long term and expressed his assessment : &quot; gold will continue to serve as a secure savings com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty .
it is sometimes over@@ looked that the high debt levels of many Western G@@ over@@ n@@ ments are at@@ tri@@ but@@ able to &apos; lack of discipline &apos; .
governments are trying to reduce their debts by de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ating the value of their cur@@ ren@@ cies .
this is why gold prices will rise above current levels , &quot; was his evaluation .
&quot; in the long term , gold is improving its ability to reduce market risks &quot;
Mar@@ cus Gru@@ b@@ b , investment general manager of the World G@@ old Council , indicated that gold is a simple , transparent and secure physical entity , and financial markets are getting increasingly complex and v@@ ola@@ tile , and said , &quot; In the long term , gold is improving instead of de@@ ter@@ i@@ or@@ ating in terms of its basic developed features and ability to reduce market risks .
por@@ t@@ fol@@ i@@ os of small qu@@ anti@@ ties of gold - demonstrating improved yield stability - are usually far more dur@@ able and they have proved to be better in cop@@ ing with the unc@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ties in the market , &quot; he said .
pointing out that investment in gold has been on the rise steadily over the past 10 years , Gru@@ b@@ b said , &quot; G@@ old represents less than 1 % of global investments in various entities .
it means that market opportunities are still very significant for the growth of investments in gold .
during this quarter , strong capital inf@@ lo@@ ws in gold bul@@ lion and co@@ ins , which increased by 78 % compared to the previous year , is an indication that the investors &apos; interest is protected , &quot; he said .
to support economic growth , India should increase its national gold sto@@ cks &quot;
Gru@@ b@@ b responded to the questions on the largest gold markets in India and China by saying that the drop in gold prices in the second quarter encouraged the demand for je@@ wel@@ ler@@ y , gold bul@@ lion and co@@ ins , and this has enhanced the investment appe@@ ti@@ te of Asian consumers .
Gru@@ b@@ b said that in the above @-@ mentioned period , the demand for gold je@@ wel@@ ler@@ y increased by 54 % in China and 51 % percent in India .
Gru@@ b@@ b explained that Chinese consumers had an advantage by buying gold at lower prices and selling it when the price has a rising trend , and said , &quot; In terms of je@@ wel@@ ler@@ y demand , China generally remained silent in the second half of the year .
following the un@@ expected fall in gold prices in April , there was an increase in demand and je@@ wel@@ ler@@ y sto@@ cks were sold out quickly . &quot;
Gru@@ b@@ b said that in India , apart from restrictions imposed by the Government on gold imports , the Indian Central Bank implemented measures to support the de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ating value of the rup@@ ee and preventing foreign currency out@@ flows and said : &quot; the nature of gold demand - restric@@ ting the retail demand level for gold - looks difficult and hence the demand can be met by un@@ author@@ ized channels .
the World G@@ old Council believes that in line with the India &apos;s policies , gold should be regarded as a strategic investment com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty .
moreover , in line with long @-@ term policy targets and to support economic growth , it must increase its national gold sto@@ cks , &quot; was his evaluation .
global G@@ old T@@ ren@@ ds
according to the World G@@ old Council &apos;s report on global gold trends , global gold demand in the second quarter of the current year was 8@@ 5@@ 6.@@ 3 t@@ ons while investments in global gold bul@@ lion and co@@ ins were 5@@ 08 t@@ ons .
while seeing a significant increase in the demand for je@@ wel@@ ler@@ y by countries in the second quarter of the year , compared to the same period in the previous year , je@@ wel@@ ler@@ y demand in China increased by 54 % , in India by 51 % , in Turkey by 38 % and in the Middle East by 33 % .
during this period , consumer demand in China continued to grow strongly , with the expec@@ tation of price increase in the periods to come , and gold pur@@ ch@@ ases rose by 87 % compared to the same quarter last year and reached 2@@ 76 t@@ ons this year .
in India , despite the Government raising taxes to dis@@ courage gold imports during the first quarter , consumer demand increased by 71 % compared to the previous year and reached 3@@ 10 t@@ ons .

the film &quot; Y@@ ou@@ ths of the H@@ ill 19@@ 80 , &quot; released today with 61 pr@@ in@@ ts , has Turkish sub@@ titles to enable the Black Sea di@@ al@@ ect to be better understood for the first time in Turkey .
star sh@@ ining on the hill !
one of the leading actors of the film , Sa@@ met Kar@@ ah@@ as@@ an@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u , is only 18 years old .
you watch everything at its best in the name of acting from Sa@@ met , who lives in Tra@@ b@@ z@@ on .
the actor who has a history of performing in ama@@ te@@ ur the@@ at@@ res handled the co@@ medy and dra@@ ma s@@ cen@@ es in the film comp@@ et@@ ently .
Sa@@ met Kar@@ ah@@ as@@ an@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u , who was appla@@ u@@ ded until the end , had the audience unanimously commenting that &quot; he will be an actor sought after in the future &quot; based on his impressive and great performance .
co@@ medy and Dra@@ ma r@@ ol@@ led into one
the subject of the film , which describes the events that took place in the village of C@@ ic@@ ek@@ li@@ d@@ Ã¼@@ z in Tra@@ b@@ z@@ on during the coup of September 12 , 19@@ 80 , is as follows :
&quot; the father of the leading character of the film , H@@ ik@@ met , is working in Germany .
H@@ ik@@ met , going to school during the winter season and engaged as a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d during the summer season , dre@@ ams of becoming a doctor after completing his education .
however it is not very easy to study when you are working .
the love he has for Z@@ u@@ le@@ y@@ ha , the daughter of the rich@@ est family in the village , only makes things all the more difficult .
deciding to dis@@ close to Z@@ u@@ le@@ y@@ ha about his love for her that he sup@@ pressed for years with the advice he gets from his friends , H@@ ik@@ met finds there is a very difficult obstacle for him to sur@@ m@@ oun@@ t in the form of Z@@ u@@ le@@ y@@ ha &apos;s father Sab@@ ri A@@ ga .
Sab@@ ri A@@ ga has different plans for his daughter .

at the gal@@ a , the film &apos;s s@@ cre@@ en@@ writer and director , Dr@@ . Is@@ met Er@@ ay@@ d@@ Ä±@@ n said they made the film with a very tight budget :
&quot; our purpose was to sho@@ ot a short film when we started .
but the first s@@ cen@@ es that they shot attracted such great interest in the social media that we were started feeling motivated about making it a long film and we made it .
when we ap@@ pro@@ ac@@ hed a distribution company in Istanbul , they asked us if we had any popular actors .
I said that we did not have any popular actors , but that we have 86 actors from the Black Sea who you can never find elsewhere . &quot;
the films and TV shows made so far have had p@@ len@@ ty of poor quality di@@ al@@ ec@@ ts used and the Black Sea people were por@@ tr@@ ay@@ ed inc@@ or@@ rec@@ tly .
you will see 86 people originally from the Black Sea people in the film a little later .
I tried to sho@@ ot a Black Sea film .
I wish that others could have shot a film before I did , in which case we could have watched a co@@ medy film without swe@@ ar words being used .
if the people from the Black Sea had not been por@@ tr@@ ay@@ ed inc@@ or@@ rec@@ tly , I would not have had to sho@@ ot the film .
we used Turkish sub@@ titles in a Turkish film for the first time .
this is a first too .
we did it so that the Black Sea di@@ al@@ ect could be understood better .
we put sub@@ titles for the English dialogue in the film to get it translated into the Black Sea di@@ al@@ ect .
who@@ ever the cam@@ era focused on happened to be an actor when shooting that film .
&quot; y@@ ou@@ ths of the H@@ ill &quot; is our first film .
there may be mistakes and shortcomings &quot; he said .
do not mis@@ s this warm @-@ he@@ ar@@ ted film , which blo@@ ws fresh bre@@ ath into the Black sea movies .
pay attention when selec@@ ting your per@@ f@@ um@@ e
you need to pay attention if you are highly concerned about personal care and if you ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate and s@@ wing around with the per@@ f@@ um@@ e bot@@ tle in your hand .
the per@@ f@@ um@@ e you use may cause s@@ kin diseases .
we discussed with der@@ mat@@ ologist Dr@@ . F@@ un@@ da At@@ am@@ an of H@@ is@@ ar Inter@@ contin@@ ental Hospital about Po@@ ik@@ il@@ o@@ der@@ ma of Ci@@ v@@ at@@ te , which is more common in women than men and may be caused by various cos@@ me@@ tic articles , primarily per@@ fu@@ mes .
Po@@ ik@@ il@@ o@@ der@@ ma of Ci@@ v@@ at@@ te is a s@@ kin p@@ ig@@ men@@ t@@ ation dis@@ order seen on the sides and back of the nec@@ k and cle@@ av@@ age ( not the area sha@@ do@@ wed by ch@@ in ) , Dr@@ .

it is man@@ i@@ f@@ es@@ ted as bro@@ wn and red marks .
the s@@ kin becomes th@@ in@@ ner , ve@@ ined and ha@@ ir roots are more evident .
pul@@ se d@@ y@@ e las@@ er treatment and protection from sun@@ light is one treatment option .
another option is the use of cre@@ ams containing re@@ t@@ in@@ o@@ ic ac@@ id .
these cre@@ ams must be used for a long time .
R@@ ed@@ n@@ ess , dr@@ ying and it@@ ching during use are side effects or an al@@ ler@@ gic reaction .
in this case , treatment should continue inter@@ mit@@ ten@@ tly .
since it could be her@@ edi@@ tar@@ y , those whose parents have Po@@ ik@@ il@@ o@@ der@@ ma of Ci@@ v@@ at@@ te must be informed about protection and treatment at an early age , &quot; she explained .
a large decrease in cigarette consumption
the number of cigarettes s@@ m@@ oked in the first six months this year in Turkey decreased by 10 percent compared to the same period last year and fell to 41 billion 7@@ 79 million .
the number of cigarettes s@@ m@@ oked in the first six months this year in Turkey decreased by 10 percent compared to the same period last year and fell to 41 billion 7@@ 79 million 19@@ 0 thousand 5@@ 60 .
according to the information from the T@@ ob@@ ac@@ co and Al@@ co@@ ho@@ l Market Re@@ gu@@ la@@ tory Authority ( TA@@ PDK ) , the Global ad@@ ul@@ t T@@ ob@@ ac@@ co Sur@@ v@@ ey ( G@@ AT@@ S ) conducted by Turkish Statistical Institute , whose objective was to obtain information about the status of the ad@@ ults in Turkey who use tobacco products and to create a database as a source for researchers and decision makers , has been completed .
according to the results of the survey , 3@@ 1.2 percent of individuals 15 years and above ( 16 million people ) in Turkey used tobacco products every day or oc@@ cas@@ ion@@ ally in 2008 , while in 2012 this number fell to 2@@ 7.@@ 1 percent ( 14.@@ 8 million people ) and the f@@ re@@ qu@@ ency of use of tobacco products decreased by 13.@@ 4 percent .
4@@ 1.5 percent of men and 13.@@ 1 percent of women use tobacco
the usage rate of tobacco products in men fell from 4@@ 7.@@ 9 percent to 4@@ 1.5 percent and in women it reduced from 15.@@ 2 percent to 13.@@ 1 percent .
according to the survey , 6 out of 10 people using tobacco products are con@@ tem@@ pla@@ ting qu@@ it@@ ting smoking .
the r@@ ati@@ o of those con@@ tem@@ pla@@ ting qu@@ it@@ ting in one month &apos;s time was 12.@@ 9 percent and those doing so in 12 months &apos; time was 3@@ 5.@@ 4 percent .
in the evaluation section of the study the following views were expressed :
&quot; the net result in terms of consumption of tobacco products indicates that the tobacco control laws and the National T@@ ob@@ ac@@ co Control Programme and Action Plan in Turkey have been implemented effectively .
in this manner , the number of consumers of tobacco products decreased by 2 millions 200 thousands people from 2008 to 2012 , and the f@@ re@@ qu@@ ency of use reduced by 4.@@ 1 percent . significant reduction of the cigarettes consumption took place among price @-@ sensitive consumers such as y@@ oun@@ g@@ sters and the less @-@ educated section of the population .
according to the report of the World Health Organ@@ ization published in 2013 on the Global T@@ ob@@ ac@@ co E@@ pi@@ demic , Turkey , in terms of tobacco control , achieved a high degree of success and became the first and only country to have met all the criteria .
in the report , other countries were asked to follow the example set by Turkey . &quot;
the ban on smoking in in@@ door areas continues to have a favourable impact .
the number of cigarettes s@@ m@@ oked in the first 6 months this year reduced by 10 percent compared to the same period last year and fell to 41 billion 7@@ 79 million 19@@ 0 thousand 5@@ 60 .
this figure was 46 billion 3@@ 25 million 4@@ 40 thousand 100 units in the same period in 2012 .

another innovation from An@@ dro@@ id
this pat@@ ent taken by Google will si@@ mp@@ lif@@ y &apos; sending and receiving files &apos; even further .
by far , An@@ dro@@ id is the leader among mobile operating Sy@@ stems and Google has been awarded a pat@@ ent for a new inter@@ face technology that works for those who frequently share files with friends .
the function supports content sharing over wireless technologies such as N@@ F@@ C and B@@ lu@@ et@@ o@@ ot@@ h , and in fact , is not very different from An@@ dro@@ id Be@@ am and Ap@@ ple A@@ ir@@ drop .
Google &apos;s latest innovation im@@ ple@@ ments this feature by allowing sending data to groups of users that are nearby instead of single sharing and offers users the ease and com@@ for@@ t of dra@@ g and drop .

this is Turkey &apos;s first local s@@ m@@ art@@ phone
Turk@@ cell entered the s@@ m@@ art@@ phones business segment
the s@@ m@@ art@@ phones factory will be based in Turkey and the phones shall be produced in partnership with China .
it is called the T@@ 40
Turk@@ cell has introduced Turkey &apos;s first local s@@ m@@ art@@ phone .
T@@ CE@@ L@@ L is launching the T@@ 40 s@@ m@@ art@@ phone designed in Turkey and to be produced in collaboration with China in Turkey by the end of September .
Turk@@ cell CEO Su@@ re@@ y@@ ya C@@ ili@@ v said that they are planning to sell the T@@ 40 s@@ m@@ art@@ phone , which was developed in collaboration with US c@@ hi@@ p manufacturer Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m , presented as Ge@@ b@@ ze project in February , in all nine countries where Turk@@ cell has its operations .
making a presentation at the launch of T@@ 40 , C@@ ili@@ v said that they met Turkish manufac@@ turers and added , &quot; Par@@ t of the T@@ 40 production is in China and its production will start in Turkey until the end of 2013 . &quot;
it W@@ I@@ L@@ L B@@ E affordable
saying that they would launch the telephone at an affordable price , C@@ ili@@ v informed that the final price would be announced shortly prior to the commen@@ cement of sales .
C@@ ili@@ v said that with the T@@ 40 , they intended to launch an affordable s@@ m@@ art@@ phone in the market , and to encourage and increase data usage and enhance revenues in this way rather than making profits from sales of the device .
saying that 1 million units of the T series phones have been sold since it was launched by Turk@@ cell in 2010 , C@@ ili@@ v indicated that these sales reduced the foreign trade deficit by 500 million T@@ L .

in a speech at the meeting , President of the Information and Com@@ m@@ un@@ ic@@ ation T@@ ech@@ n@@ olo@@ gies Authority ( IC@@ T@@ A ) , T@@ ay@@ f@@ un A@@ car@@ er said that they supported local production : &quot; 57 percent of the phones coming to Turkey are s@@ m@@ art@@ phones .
the average phone price has reached 300 dollars as a result of the increase in this r@@ ati@@ o .
out of 15 million units , we import phones worth 5 billion dollars every year and my concern is that this amount will keep increasing &quot; he said .
the T@@ 40 will use the An@@ dro@@ id operating System and it will have a Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m dual @-@ core pro@@ ces@@ s@@ or and 1 G@@ B of ra@@ m .
they all go to I@@ ma@@ m H@@ ati@@ p !
students studying at normal secondary school became students of the ima@@ m H@@ ati@@ p religious secondary school .
the Ministry of Education , following the 4 + 4 + 4 education system , con@@ ver@@ ted all primary schools in Turkey to primary schools , secondary schools and ima@@ m H@@ ati@@ p secondary schools last year .
after one year of education , the Ministry con@@ ver@@ ted a large number of schools into ima@@ m H@@ ati@@ p schools in line with new &quot; requirements , &quot; and these , as signed by the Ministry have been revealed as a scandal in the course of con@@ ver@@ sions .
the con@@ version scandal may be of interest to all current students at schools that were con@@ ver@@ ted into ima@@ m H@@ ati@@ p secondary schools and which sur@@ faced in the course of ren@@ e@@ wing the reg@@ ist@@ r@@ ations at S@@ ek@@ er Sec@@ on@@ d@@ ary School in Kon@@ ya &apos;s Mer@@ am district .
one year of normal secondary school
S@@ ek@@ er Pri@@ m@@ ary School , following the 4 + 4 + 4 system , has been con@@ ver@@ ted into a secondary school at the beginning of last year .
at the school , students in the 3 and 4 gra@@ des who will go to another school as required by the system , and those in the 6 , 7 and 8@@ . gra@@ des of secondary school had been studying together .
after operating as a normal secondary school for one year , it was con@@ ver@@ ted into ima@@ m H@@ ati@@ p secondary school at the end of the 2012 @-@ 2013 academic year .
after being con@@ ver@@ ted into ima@@ m H@@ ati@@ p , the school accepted its 5 grade students as &quot; ima@@ m H@@ ati@@ p students &quot; for the first time .
however , students who were registered in 5 grade of a normal secondary school last year , and who would have been in the 6 grade this year , have been automatically re @-@ registered as students of an ima@@ m H@@ ati@@ p secondary school .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like it , go to another school &quot;
parents who became aware of the situation went to school to complain .
however , the school administration , based on instruc@@ tions from the Pro@@ v@@ in@@ cial National Education Directorate , said , &quot; Par@@ ents who do not want their children to continue at ima@@ m H@@ ati@@ p may register at another secondary school . &quot;
the declaration made by Kon@@ ya Pro@@ v@@ in@@ ce National Education Directorate contained some interesting ex@@ pres@@ sions .
the declaration said : &quot; by taking the number of students into account and schools with the approval of Kon@@ ya G@@ over@@ n@@ or@@ ship , we have con@@ ver@@ ted some schools again . in this context , 15 @-@ 20 schools in Kon@@ ya were con@@ ver@@ ted into ima@@ m H@@ ati@@ p . &quot;
schools enter the e @-@ school system of the ministry with their school co@@ des .
but when the school is con@@ ver@@ ted into an ima@@ m H@@ ati@@ p , its previous school code is de@@ le@@ ted from the system .
a new school code must be assigned and the students must be re @-@ registered .
for not vic@@ ti@@ m@@ iz@@ ing the students and the teachers of the schools with the changed co@@ des , these schools transferred the students to ima@@ m H@@ ati@@ p secondary school using the new school code .
parents can transfer their children to another school if they want , &quot; so it was said .

it was discovered subsequently that the life of M@@ r D@@ ul@@ gun who was treated in the hospital , was not in danger .
in the meantime , by@@ stand@@ ers said that the am@@ bul@@ ance was late in ar@@ ri@@ ving at the scene .
the police started an investigation into the accident .
the prosecutor said to the ministry , &quot; L@@ et it be &quot;
a demand made by the F@@ am@@ ily Ministry was rejected
SE@@ Y@@ M@@ A U@@ l@@ us@@ o@@ y / V@@ at@@ an intelligence
at the trial of Ab@@ b@@ as Å@@ ah@@ in , who killed his wife P@@ Ä±@@ n@@ ar Å@@ ah@@ in , 24 , because she filed for di@@ v@@ or@@ ce , the prosecutor rejected a demand for intervention by the F@@ am@@ ily Ministry on the grounds that it was not a case of violence .
the victim &apos;s mother , Ay@@ Å@@ e Ä°@@ k@@ iz and s@@ is@@ ter , H@@ edi@@ y@@ e Ä°@@ k@@ iz attended the first hearing of the trial proceedings held at the F@@ if@@ th Bak@@ ir@@ k@@ Ã¶@@ y Criminal Court of pr@@ is@@ on@@ er Ab@@ b@@ as Å@@ ah@@ in , who murdered his wife P@@ Ä±@@ n@@ ar Å@@ ah@@ in .
defendant Ab@@ b@@ as Å@@ ah@@ in presented a 4 page defence to the court .
in his defence , M@@ r Å@@ ah@@ in said , &quot; M@@ y wife wanted my help to make a new beginning .
when we met she asked to rent a house but did not want me to know where the house was .
I lost control and pul@@ led out a gun that I had with me .
at the time my wife was holding on to the ste@@ ering wh@@ e@@ el .
the gun went off when the car sw@@ er@@ ved to the side .
my wife fell on my arm .
I later took her to a pol@@ y@@ clinic .
&quot; I regret it , &quot; he said .
if we accept it , they will intervene in every case
&quot; my daughter was 14 when she got married , &quot; said mother Ay@@ Å@@ e Ä°@@ k@@ iz .
&quot; he in@@ d@@ ul@@ ged in violence on my daughter during the entire time that they were married , &quot; she said and the victim &apos;s s@@ is@@ ter H@@ edi@@ y@@ e Ä°@@ k@@ iz said that the defendant had kidn@@ apped her s@@ is@@ ter twice .
following complaints from the mother and the s@@ is@@ ter , a lawyer for the Ministry of Women and Social Wel@@ fare requested that the ministry be allowed to participate in the trial .
describing his opinion to the court about the plea , the court prosecutor Tar@@ Ä±@@ k Dur@@ sun Ben@@ de@@ z said , &quot; E@@ ven though it says in Article 20 of Law 6@@ 2@@ 84 that &quot; A ministry , in case of need , can participate in all kinds of administrative , criminal , li@@ ti@@ g@@ ations and conten@@ tious jurisdiction involving violence on women , children and family members , &quot; the trial mentioned is not a case of violence but a criminal case , and even the plea is contrary to the equality and gender discrimination clause of Article 10 of the constitution , and if the opinion is not accepted , the Ministry of Women and Social Wel@@ fare will want to be associated with every trial involving a woman victim , so we propose that the plea be rejected . &quot;
the court granted the request of the prosecutor .
it was accepted until today
in A@@ Ä@@ r@@ Ä± , the Ministry of Women and Social Wel@@ fare requested for being allowed to intervene in the trial of a man and his family who murdered his wife M@@ ele@@ k Kar@@ a@@ as@@ lan .
the court considered the ministry &apos;s request to be justi@@ fi@@ able and granted it .
the Ministry of Women and Social Wel@@ fare is involved in the trial of the man who pushed his wife , a teacher named E@@ s@@ in G@@ Ã¼@@ n@@ e@@ Å off a c@@ lif@@ f .

in 9@@ 11 C@@ all , Professor Ad@@ mits to Sho@@ oting g@@ ir@@ l@@ friend
in a 9@@ 11 call , his voice only slightly s@@ h@@ ak@@ y , col@@ le@@ ge professor S@@ han@@ non lam@@ b told police he had shot his g@@ ir@@ l@@ friend and officers needed to get over to their house .
lam@@ b made a point to say his &quot; swe@@ et do@@ g &quot; was there alive and probably up@@ set , and said the dead woman &apos;s family contacts could be found on her phone .
inside the home , officers found A@@ my P@@ ren@@ ti@@ s@@ s &apos; body and a hand @-@ written note s@@ cri@@ b@@ b@@ led on a white legal p@@ ad : &quot; I am so very sor@@ ry I wish I could take it back I lov@@ ed A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever lov@@ ed me , &quot; read the letter authorities say was signed by lam@@ b .
there was no indication that lam@@ b , who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in C@@ lev@@ el@@ and , Mis@@ s@@ is@@ si@@ p@@ p@@ i , had already trav@@ eled 300 mil@@ es to the school &apos;s camp@@ us , where police believe he shot and killed a well @-@ lik@@ ed history professor , E@@ than Sch@@ mid@@ t , in the do@@ or@@ way to his office .
Delta State University police chief L@@ y@@ n@@ n Bu@@ for@@ d said university officials heard about the shooting at 10 : 18 a@@ .@@ m@@ .
he said lam@@ b made the fa@@ te@@ ful 9@@ 11 call so@@ me@@ time after that .
by the end of the day , there would be one more death : lam@@ b took his own life as police closed in on him .
a day after the school shooting forced students and fac@@ ul@@ ty to hide behind locked doors , authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated lam@@ b .
the details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped pain@@ t a picture of a tal@@ en@@ ted but possibly troubled teacher .
students said they looked forward to his class .
police in G@@ au@@ ti@@ er , where P@@ ren@@ ti@@ s@@ s died , said he had no history of violence or criminal record .
Sch@@ mid@@ t himself had included lam@@ b in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the &quot; won@@ der@@ ful people &quot; he shared his academic life with .
both ta@@ ug@@ h@@ t in the Di@@ vision of Social Sciences and H@@ ist@@ ory , which lists 17 fac@@ ul@@ ty members , and many students took courses from both .
at the same time , there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations of problems .
a student who praised lam@@ b , Br@@ and@@ on Be@@ aver@@ s , said he also seemed ag@@ it@@ ated and j@@ it@@ tery , &quot; like there was something wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ ke@@ l Sy@@ k@@ es , said lam@@ b told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014 @-@ 15 academic year .
lam@@ b had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence , saying he had a health issue of some sort .
this year , he was only teaching two online classes .
recent changes in the university &apos;s h@@ ir@@ ing policies meant that the do@@ c@@ tor@@ ate lam@@ b had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an auto@@ matic tenure track to become an assistant professor .
University President W@@ il@@ li@@ am La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know of any conflict between lam@@ b and Sch@@ mid@@ t but &quot; obviously there was something in Mr. lam@@ b &apos;s mind . &quot;
those are questions lam@@ b can no longer answer .
after fle@@ eing the camp@@ us , police later pic@@ ked up lam@@ b &apos;s tra@@ il when he cr@@ os@@ sed back into Mis@@ s@@ is@@ si@@ p@@ p@@ i from Ar@@ k@@ an@@ sa@@ s .
before he could be apprehended , lam@@ b killed himself with a single .@@ 38 @-@ cal@@ i@@ ber p@@ ist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a home about a m@@ ile south of his parents &apos; home on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of Gre@@ en@@ v@@ il@@ le , Mis@@ s@@ is@@ si@@ p@@ p@@ i , said Washington County Cor@@ on@@ er Me@@ the@@ l Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b went to that home , though Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lam@@ b grew up in the area .
lam@@ b started working at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12,000 , in 2009 and ta@@ ug@@ h@@ t geo@@ graphy and education classes .
he received a do@@ c@@ tor@@ ate in education in the spring .
one of lam@@ b &apos;s l@@ ong@@ time friends described him as s@@ mar@@ t , char@@ is@@ matic and fun@@ ny .
Carla H@@ air@@ st@@ on said she was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the co@@ ol older gu@@ y who tried for several years to te@@ ach her to play gu@@ it@@ ar .
he was quite the he@@ art@@ th@@ ro@@ b back then .
all the girls would mel@@ t when he was around , &quot; said H@@ air@@ st@@ on , now 40 and living in the J@@ ack@@ son su@@ bur@@ b of Br@@ and@@ on .
lam@@ b and P@@ ren@@ ti@@ s@@ s had apparently been dating for some time .
in the 9@@ 11 call , lam@@ b said &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no record of them ever mar@@ r@@ ying .
they had a do@@ g named L@@ igh@@ t@@ ning that lived with them at the bri@@ ck house that backs up to a b@@ ay@@ ou in G@@ au@@ ti@@ er .
police said the do@@ g was O@@ K .
P@@ ren@@ ti@@ s@@ s &apos; ex @-@ husband , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they di@@ v@@ or@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who &apos;s now 19 .
&quot; she was completely dev@@ as@@ ta@@ ted , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said of his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had not met lam@@ b but heard through his daughter A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il that lam@@ b was interested in music and played the b@@ lu@@ es .
lam@@ b met P@@ ren@@ ti@@ s@@ s when he and A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il both performed at a summer fair three years ago .
later , they played together in the oc@@ cas@@ i@@ onal gi@@ g .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and s@@ ings her own music .
P@@ ren@@ ti@@ s@@ s was a nur@@ se who worked for various companies online .
Mik@@ e Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment co@@ ordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Ro@@ om , a di@@ m@@ ly li@@ t bar near G@@ au@@ ti@@ er , said he last saw lam@@ b and P@@ ren@@ ti@@ s@@ s the night of S@@ ep@@ t . 5 , after lam@@ b had finished playing his gu@@ it@@ ar and har@@ mon@@ ica for a spar@@ se crowd .
there was no sign of anything am@@ is@@ s .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were cutting up and th@@ ro@@ wing one @-@ lin@@ ers at each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of w@@ it about them .
Sch@@ mid@@ t , the sla@@ in professor , directed the first @-@ year seminar pro@@ gra@@ m and speci@@ al@@ ized in N@@ ative American and col@@ on@@ ial history , said D@@ on Al@@ lan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three young children .
he stu@@ died at Em@@ por@@ ia State University in Kan@@ sa@@ s and was president of his f@@ r@@ ater@@ n@@ ity and student government .
on the Delta State camp@@ us in C@@ lev@@ el@@ and on Tuesday night , about 900 people , including fac@@ ul@@ ty members , staff , students , and members of the community , attended a cand@@ le@@ light memorial .

UN Chief Says Th@@ ere I@@ s No Military Sol@@ u@@ tion in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s stepped up military support for Syria is that &quot; there is no military solution &quot; to the nearly five @-@ year conflict and more weapons will only wor@@ sen the violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
the U@@ .@@ N@@ . chief again urged all parties , including the divided U@@ .@@ N@@ . Security Council , to unite and support inc@@ lu@@ sive negotiations to find a political solution .
ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U@@ .@@ S@@ . , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly &apos;s ministerial session later this month to discuss Syria .
he expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers &quot; made this situation un@@ sol@@ v@@ able . &quot;
ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis .
8 Pol@@ l N@@ um@@ bers Th@@ at S@@ how Donald Tr@@ ump I@@ s For Re@@ al
some have tried to la@@ bel him a f@@ li@@ p @-@ F@@ l@@ op@@ per .
others have dismissed him as a j@@ oke .
and some are holding out for an im@@ pl@@ os@@ ion .
but no matter how some Re@@ p@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to dra@@ g Donald Tr@@ ump down from at@@ o@@ p the polls , it has@@ n &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s lead at double dig@@ its , and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l &apos;s nomination chances .
of course , it &apos;s still early in the election cycle .
none of this is to say that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
pun@@ di@@ ts point out that at this time in 2011 , R@@ ic@@ k Per@@ ry &apos;s lead was giving way to a rising Herman C@@ ain , neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process .
and there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election .
but outside groups like Je@@ b Bush &apos;s Su@@ per PA@@ C and the economic conservative group Club for Gro@@ w@@ th are re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ z@@ ing Tr@@ ump &apos;s staying power and beginning to un@@ lo@@ ad their dollars to top@@ ple him .
here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l isn &apos;t just a passing phase :
tr@@ ump &apos;s f@@ av@@ or@@ ability ratings have turned 180 degrees .
right before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candidacy in mid @-@ June , a Mon@@ m@@ ou@@ th University poll showed only two in 10 Re@@ p@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans had a positive view of the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
in early August , it was 52 percent .
now , six in 10 Re@@ p@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a f@@ av@@ or@@ able view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
roughly three in 10 say they have a negative view .
and these numbers hold up in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac poll in I@@ ow@@ a last week found that 60 percent of Re@@ p@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans there had a f@@ av@@ or@@ able view of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of G@@ O@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as the nomin@@ ee .
in a CNN / O@@ R@@ C poll last week , 67 percent of Re@@ p@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans said they would be either &quot; en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ tic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump were the nomin@@ ee .
only two in 10 say they would be &quot; up@@ set &quot; if he were the nomin@@ ee .
only B@@ en Car@@ son gener@@ ates roughly the same level of en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ tic &quot; v@@ s@@ . 40 percent who say the same of Tr@@ ump ) .
the next clos@@ est in en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m ?
Mar@@ co Ru@@ bi@@ o with only 21 percent .
on the f@@ li@@ p side , 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; up@@ set &quot; if establishment f@@ av@@ or@@ ite Je@@ b Bush becomes the nomin@@ ee .
a majority of Re@@ p@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans don &apos;t see Tr@@ ump &apos;s tem@@ per@@ am@@ ent as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump has been widely cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed for his b@@ om@@ b@@ ast and ins@@ ults , 52 percent of le@@ an@@ ed Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per@@ am@@ ent to be president , according to Monday &apos;s AB@@ C News / Washington Post poll .
the same number holds in the first @-@ in @-@ the @-@ nation ca@@ uc@@ us state of I@@ ow@@ a , where the same 52 percent of Re@@ p@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans think he has the person@@ ality to be commander in chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
still , 44 percent think he doesn &apos;t have the person@@ ality to serve effectively , and almost six in 10 in@@ de@@ pen@@ dents say his tem@@ per@@ am@@ ent does not belong in the White House , according to AB@@ C / Post .
Republican voters are getting used to the idea .
when they put on their pun@@ di@@ t hat@@ s , Republican voters think Tr@@ ump is for real .
when asked who is most likely to win the G@@ O@@ P nomination , four in 10 said Tr@@ ump was the best bet , according to a CNN / O@@ R@@ C poll out last week .
that &apos;s a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Je@@ b Bush in late July .
full dis@@ closure : G@@ O@@ P voters haven &apos;t had the cle@@ ar@@ est cr@@ y@@ st@@ al ball in the past .
at this time last cycle , four in 10 Re@@ p@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans pic@@ ked R@@ ic@@ k Per@@ ry to win the nomination , v@@ s@@ . only 28 percent for eventual nomin@@ ee Mit@@ t R@@ om@@ ne@@ y .
still , it shows that a plur@@ ality of G@@ O@@ P voters see Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign as pla@@ u@@ sible .
even if Re@@ p@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans ral@@ lied around another candidate , Tr@@ ump still be@@ ats almost everyone .
some pun@@ di@@ ts point out that the sp@@ l@@ inter@@ ed field is likely contributing to Tr@@ ump &apos;s lead , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is be spread di@@ ff@@ us@@ ely among more than a dozen other candidates .
but a Mon@@ m@@ ou@@ th University poll in early September shows that , in a hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head mat@@ ch@@ up between Tr@@ ump and most other Republican candidates , Tr@@ ump almost always gar@@ ners majority support .
he leads C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina by 13 points , Mar@@ co Ru@@ bi@@ o by 14 points , W@@ al@@ k@@ er by 15 points , Je@@ b Bush by 19 points , and , finally , R@@ AN@@ D Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Ch@@ ri@@ s Ch@@ r@@ isti@@ e by 33 points each .
he &apos;s in a dead heat with T@@ ed C@@ ru@@ z .
the only candidate who be@@ ats him ?
B@@ en Car@@ son would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head .
a b@@ are majority of Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s supporters say they &apos;ve made up their min@@ ds .
a new C@@ B@@ S / N@@ Y@@ T poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have locked in their votes .
obviously , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say they would never change their mind .
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to s@@ w@@ it@@ ching candidates .
still , Tr@@ ump &apos;s strongest competition at the moment is from fellow out@@ si@@ der ne@@ ur@@ os@@ ur@@ ge@@ on B@@ en Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made up their min@@ ds are twice as likely to go for Tr@@ ump .
six in 10 Re@@ p@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
even since Donald Tr@@ ump called immigrants from M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; in his campaign announcement speech two months ago , immigration has been front and cen@@ ter in the 20@@ 16 conversation .
some are worried that Tr@@ ump &apos;s b@@ om@@ b@@ ast will drive crucial H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic voters away from the Republican Party and damage re@@ br@@ an@@ ding efforts .
but according to Monday &apos;s new AB@@ C / Post poll , six in 10 Re@@ p@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues .
so as long as immigration remains in the sp@@ ot@@ light , it seems Donald Tr@@ ump will remain too .
frustration with government is clim@@ bing to new hi@@ gh@@ s .
Donald Tr@@ ump and B@@ en Car@@ son now account for roughly half of the support from Republican voters , largely due to their out@@ si@@ der status .
six in 10 Re@@ p@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in Monday &apos;s new AB@@ C / Post poll say they want a political out@@ si@@ der over someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington , too .
a D@@ es Mo@@ ines Reg@@ is@@ ter / Bloomberg poll in I@@ ow@@ a from two weeks ago shows that three in four I@@ ow@@ a Re@@ p@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are fru@@ stra@@ ted with Re@@ p@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; ma@@ d as hel@@ l . &quot;
J@@ er@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n to make debut at Prime Minister &apos;s Qu@@ es@@ tions
since his election , M@@ r Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at P@@ M@@ Q@@ s has been ke@@ en@@ ly awaited
new Labour leader J@@ er@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to make his debut at Prime Minister &apos;s Qu@@ es@@ tions later , taking on David Cam@@ er@@ on for the first time .
M@@ r Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six al@@ lot@@ ted questions shortly after mid@@ day , with his performance likely to be closely s@@ c@@ ru@@ tin@@ ised by the media and Labour MPs .
he has called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at the weekly show@@ piece .
he has also said he could sk@@ ip some sessions , leaving them to colleagues .
the en@@ counter will be the first parliamentary test of M@@ r Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , coming after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech to the T@@ U@@ C annual congress on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to stand in s@@ il@@ ence during the sing@@ ing of the national an@@ them at a service on Tuesday to mark the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the B@@ at@@ t@@ le of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers .
M@@ r Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokesman for M@@ r Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in res@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ ful s@@ il@@ ence &quot; and did recognise the &quot; her@@ o@@ ism of the R@@ oy@@ al Air Force in the B@@ at@@ t@@ le of Britain . &quot;
but a member of M@@ r Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ w@@ en S@@ mit@@ h , told BBC T@@ w@@ o &apos;s Ne@@ w@@ s@@ night programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them &quot; ir@@ respective &quot; of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be abolished .
nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in M@@ r Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , citing differences over the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader .
BBC political correspondent R@@ ob@@ in Bran@@ t says policy differences are also &quot; st@@ ac@@ king up &quot; within Labour following M@@ r Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment over its position on the European Union and the government &apos;s ca@@ p on benefits .
M@@ r Cor@@ by@@ n told the T@@ U@@ C conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a ca@@ p altogether .
hours later M@@ r S@@ mit@@ h , the shadow work and pensions secretary , said the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of ca@@ p from Â£ 2@@ 6,000 to Â£ 2@@ 3,000 .
M@@ r Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cam@@ er@@ on has faced across the de@@ sp@@ at@@ ch box over the past decade since he became T@@ ory leader .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different approach to politics , says he has &quot; crowd so@@ ur@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to ask M@@ r Cam@@ er@@ on and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ l@@ ing@@ ton North MP has said P@@ M@@ Q@@ s is too confron@@ t@@ ational and that he will refrain from both &quot; re@@ par@@ te@@ e &quot; and trading bar@@ bs , instead vowing to focus on serious issues such as poverty , in@@ equality and the challenges facing young people .
M@@ r Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela E@@ ag@@ le , the shadow business secretary , will de@@ pu@@ ti@@ se for him at P@@ M@@ Q@@ s when he does not attend - for instance when M@@ r Cam@@ er@@ on is travelling abroad .
he has also flo@@ ated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion , saying he had ap@@ pro@@ ac@@ hed the Com@@ m@@ ons Speaker John Ber@@ co@@ w to discuss the issue .
when he became leader in 2005 , M@@ r Cam@@ er@@ on said he wanted to move away from the &quot; pun@@ ch and Ju@@ dy &quot; style of politics often associated with P@@ M@@ Q@@ s but admitted some years later that he had failed .
since it was first televised in 1990 , P@@ M@@ Q@@ s has been seen as a key bar@@ o@@ me@@ ter of a leader &apos;s ju@@ d@@ ge@@ ment , their command of the Com@@ m@@ ons and their standing among their fellow MPs although critics have argued it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and is in need of far @-@ reaching reforms .

p@@ ound ris@@ es as UK wage growth ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ates
the p@@ ound jum@@ ped following data showing a pick @-@ up in UK wage growth , while the F@@ T@@ SE 100 was led higher by bid target S@@ AB@@ Miller .
between May and July , UK ear@@ nings exclu@@ ding bon@@ uses grew 2.@@ 9 % compared with the same period last year .
the rate was the fas@@ test since 2009 , and was seen as bringing forward estimates of when rates might rise .
ster@@ ling rose more than 1 % against the d@@ ol@@ lar to $ 1.@@ 5@@ 5@@ 05 and was up 0.@@ 84 % against the euro at â¬ 1.@@ 3@@ 7@@ 30 .
the F@@ T@@ SE 100 index closed up 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 2@@ 9.@@ 21 .
S@@ AB@@ Miller was the stand @-@ out stock on the market , jum@@ ping 20 % after it received a bid approach from rival A@@ B In@@ B@@ ev .
a deal would com@@ b@@ ine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ w@@ ers , bringing together br@@ an@@ ds such as Bu@@ d@@ we@@ is@@ er , Ste@@ l@@ la Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and G@@ r@@ ol@@ s@@ ch .
Bur@@ ber@@ ry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher following encouraging news from rival luxury goods group R@@ ic@@ h@@ em@@ on@@ t .
R@@ ic@@ h@@ em@@ on@@ t &apos;s latest sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ ber@@ ry - had begun to grow again .
shares in G@@ len@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said it had raised $ 2.@@ 5@@ b@@ n through a share pla@@ cement as part of its debt @-@ cutting strategy .
shares in p@@ ack@@ aging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest fal@@ lers on the index , down 4.@@ 3 % , after G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s cut its rating on the firm to &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose 3.@@ 1 % after the s@@ por@@ t@@ swe@@ ar firm reported an 83 % jump in half @-@ year pre @-@ tax profits to Â£ 4@@ 6.@@ 6@@ m@@ .
J@@ D Sports bos@@ s says higher wages could hurt expansion

Met@@ cash launches gr@@ ass@@ roots campaign to fight Al@@ di inc@@ ur@@ sion
Met@@ cash is trying to protect its I@@ G@@ A stores from an Al@@ di on@@ sla@@ ug@@ h@@ t in South Australia and Western Australia .
gro@@ cer@@ y who@@ le@@ sal@@ er Met@@ cash has kicked off a gr@@ ass@@ roots campaign to defend the market share of I@@ G@@ A re@@ ta@@ il@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $ 700 million Al@@ di inv@@ as@@ ion .
as Al@@ di prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of as many as 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ G@@ A super@@ markets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the I@@ G@@ A brand through main@@ st@@ re@@ am and social media marketing and events such as the A@@ de@@ la@@ ide show .
I@@ G@@ A re@@ ta@@ il@@ ers and suppliers are jum@@ ping on board , with br@@ an@@ ds such as D@@ un@@ s@@ bor@@ ou@@ g@@ h @-@ based ice cre@@ am maker Sim@@ mo &apos;s offering tas@@ te testing at I@@ G@@ A stores and store owners selling dis@@ counted South Australian football le@@ ag@@ ue tickets to lo@@ y@@ al customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the food , liqu@@ or and hard@@ w@@ are who@@ le@@ sal@@ er hosts its annual investor strategy day .
there is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Met@@ cash &apos;s I@@ G@@ A store foot@@ print and generate higher profit margin@@ s than Met@@ cash &apos;s I@@ G@@ A network in the eastern states .
South Australian and Western Australian sh@@ op@@ pers are not@@ ori@@ ously par@@ o@@ chi@@ al and I@@ G@@ A re@@ ta@@ il@@ ers enjoy a much stronger market share than they do in N@@ S@@ W , Vic@@ tor@@ ia and Qu@@ e@@ en@@ s@@ land - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in w@@ a compared with around 14 per cent in the Eastern states .
however , analysts such as M@@ organ Stan@@ ley believe Al@@ di will sn@@ are around 5 per cent of the gro@@ cer@@ y market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores , taking sales from all existing players but mainly from independent re@@ ta@@ il@@ ers .
in a report this week , M@@ organ Stan@@ ley analyst T@@ om K@@ i@@ er@@ ath estimated that I@@ G@@ A re@@ ta@@ il@@ ers could lose $ 3@@ 60 million a year in sales and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 20@@ 16 .
this forecast is based on the ass@@ um@@ ption that Al@@ di opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in w@@ a next year , gener@@ ating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss of food and gro@@ cer@@ y sales and vol@@ u@@ mes on Met@@ cash &apos;s high fixed @-@ cost base could cost Met@@ cash around $ 13 million in ear@@ nings before interest and tax , M@@ r K@@ i@@ er@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash is losing market share in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Co@@ les , even though a recent Ro@@ y M@@ organ survey found I@@ G@@ A sh@@ op@@ pers were most lo@@ y@@ al .
M@@ organ Stan@@ ley believes Met@@ cash &apos;s food and gro@@ cer@@ y sales will fall 3.@@ 8 per cent in 20@@ 16 , 4.@@ 1 per cent in 20@@ 17 and 2.@@ 1 per cent in 20@@ 18 , reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 per cent by 2020 .
last week , leading fund manager Ham@@ ish D@@ ou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ el@@ lan Financial Group , told a business lun@@ ch in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne that Met@@ cash could &quot; highly , probably dis@@ appear within a decade .
Met@@ cash has declined to respond publicly to M@@ r D@@ ou@@ glass &apos; comments .
but it is understood that a Met@@ cash board member con@@ t@@ acted M@@ r D@@ ou@@ glass last week .
I@@ G@@ A &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and ear@@ nings from Met@@ cash &apos;s food and gro@@ cer@@ y business , which supplies about 1@@ 200 I@@ G@@ A re@@ ta@@ il@@ ers , have fallen 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting operating de@@ le@@ ver@@ age as sales and margin@@ s come under pressure .
however , the who@@ le@@ sal@@ er is fighting back , investing more than $ 150 million a year mat@@ ching shel@@ f prices at Co@@ les and W@@ o@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths on hundreds of products each week , helping I@@ G@@ A re@@ ta@@ il@@ ers ref@@ ur@@ b@@ ish stores by adding faster @-@ growing fresh food , and r@@ ol@@ ling out a better range of private la@@ bel gro@@ cer@@ ies .
Met@@ cash chief executive I@@ an Mor@@ ri@@ ce says the price mat@@ ching and store ref@@ ur@@ bis@@ hment pro@@ gra@@ ms are gaining tr@@ action and is hoping the who@@ le@@ sal@@ er will return to under@@ lying profit growth in 20@@ 17 , for the first time in four years .

the te@@ en@@ ag@@ er is currently in G@@ las@@ go@@ w , competing with S@@ am G@@ rot@@ h for the second sing@@ les ber@@ th behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the D@@ av@@ is Cup semi @-@ final against Britain .
&quot; one thing I do feel quite ke@@ en@@ ly about is I think T@@ han@@ asi &apos;s been dra@@ gged into the fra@@ y a little bit , &quot; He@@ al@@ y said .
he did break a rac@@ qu@@ et when he lost when he c@@ ra@@ mp@@ ed in the US , but he &apos;s not the first player to break a rac@@ qu@@ et out of frustration with himself , and I know T@@ han@@ asi well enough to know he wouldn &apos;t be proud of that .
but , really , he &apos;s handled himself extremely well , in pre@@ t@@ ty provoc@@ ative circumstances in the US with Har@@ ris@@ on and so on , and I think he de@@ serves a lot of credit .
he &apos;s a great team around him , he &apos;s got a great family around him and I just think he &apos;s been a little hard done by .
he &apos;s a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he f@@ its in with the team and so on , he has@@ n &apos;t ever had an issue with the other players , he &apos;s well respected in the loc@@ ker room , he trains hard , he &apos;s in great shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young gu@@ y and I just think he de@@ serves to be ju@@ dged on his own mer@@ its .
He@@ al@@ y also backed the decision to over@@ look K@@ y@@ r@@ gi@@ os for the important ti@@ e , starting on Friday , describing the &quot; mutual decision &quot; as the right thing for all , but backing the Can@@ ber@@ ran to return as a long @-@ term fi@@ x@@ ture in the team .
&quot; first of all we want the team to be completely focused on the ti@@ e and not all the controversy around &#91; K@@ y@@ r@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ al@@ y said .
and I think Nic@@ k , he &apos;s risen very quickly , as people like F@@ ed@@ er@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out , he &apos;s growing up in the public eye and he &apos;s made some ter@@ rible er@@ r@@ ors and de@@ serves all the criticism he gets , but we &apos;re trying to support him , we &apos;re trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions , and some time out of the li@@ me@@ light where he can just reflect on that I think is appropriate and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe mig@@ rant crisis : Hungary declar@@ es emergency , se@@ als border , de@@ ta@@ in@@ s migrants
declaring a state of emergency , Hungary sealed off its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those trying to enter illegally , aiming to shut down the flow of migrants po@@ uring in .
chaos en@@ su@@ ed at the border , as hundreds of migrants p@@ iled up in a no man &apos;s land , and Serbian officials reacted with ou@@ tra@@ ge .
st@@ uc@@ k for an unknown amount of time on a stri@@ p of road between the two countries &apos; ch@@ ec@@ k@@ points , those fle@@ eing violence in their home@@ lands p@@ it@@ ched ten@@ ts and settled in .
but fru@@ str@@ ations were on the rise .
as a police helicopter h@@ over@@ ed above , migrants chan@@ ted &quot; Open the border ! &quot; and sh@@ ou@@ ted ins@@ ults at Hungarian riot police .
some refused food and water in protest .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were ar@@ ri@@ ving from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution , not col@@ la@@ ter@@ al damage .
there will have to be talks in the coming days with Brussels and other countries , &quot; Ivica Dacic said in Prague .
the turmoil at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc failed to come up with a united immigration policy at a conten@@ tious meeting in Brussels .
the ministers did agree to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking ref@@ uge in over@@ wh@@ el@@ med Italy and Greece and spoke hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly of reaching an eventual deal - next month or by the end of the year - on which EU nations would take 1@@ 20,000 more refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called Tuesday for a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , was not pin@@ ning its hopes on any action soon from Brussels or its ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors .
Tuesday &apos;s state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis , allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum court cases .
meanwhile , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said his country is also planning to build a ra@@ z@@ or @-@ w@@ ire f@@ ence along part of its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country , now that it has finished a f@@ ence on the Serbian border .
C@@ B@@ S News correspondent Char@@ lie D &apos;@@ A@@ g@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ ma@@ tes were en@@ listed in the race to finish the ra@@ z@@ or w@@ ire f@@ ence between Hungary and Serbia .
in the last few months , Hungary has become a major bot@@ t@@ len@@ ec@@ k and entry point into the European Union for migrants , many of them war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Prime Minister V@@ ik@@ tor Or@@ ban , however , has insisted that most ar@@ ri@@ ving are economic migrants seeking a better life , not war refugees entitled to protection - a view sharply at odds with other EU nations , including Germany .
the new laws that took effect at mid@@ night in Hungary now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4 @-@ me@@ ter ( 13 @-@ fo@@ ot ) ra@@ z@@ or @-@ w@@ ire f@@ ence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers .
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es a state of crisis , &quot; government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ ac@@ s told reporters in the southern city of S@@ z@@ e@@ ged .
we are very clear on this : illegal border crossing is a crime .
technically , parliament must still approve the deployment of the military , expected next week , but As@@ soci@@ ated Press reporters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ g@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , home@@ land security adviser to Or@@ ban , said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the border and 15 deeper in the country .
they got across by damaging the f@@ ence , are now in police custody and are being charged with com@@ m@@ it@@ ting offen@@ ses under the new laws .
authorities are quickly rep@@ air@@ ing the f@@ ence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after deplo@@ ying a train car covered with ra@@ z@@ or w@@ ire to close one of them .
chaos en@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , as the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal contain@@ er to process people and crowds pressed to squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze inside .
about 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary , saying they were refusing food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary .
election 20@@ 16 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead over Ber@@ ni@@ e S@@ and@@ ers cut by half in national poll
former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ dig@@ it lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nation@@ ally , but Sen@@ . Ber@@ ni@@ e S@@ and@@ ers is gaining on her .
Clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters ( down from 58 percent ) , while S@@ and@@ ers comes in second , with 27 percent ( up from 17 percent ) .
Vice President Jo@@ e Biden , who has yet to announce whether he is running for president , receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters .
more than five months before the start of the primary con@@ tests , most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their min@@ ds are made up about which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s back@@ ers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates .
since last month &apos;s C@@ B@@ S News Pol@@ l , Clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups , while S@@ and@@ ers has made some gains .
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moder@@ ates , but those leads have narro@@ wed .
her support among men has dropped considerably and S@@ and@@ ers only tra@@ ils her by 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated , and she and S@@ and@@ ers are now even .
however , Clinton still has a large lead with older voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ and@@ ers by double @-@ dig@@ its among liber@@ als , but S@@ and@@ ers now has a 5 @-@ point edge with this group .
about half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ tically support Clinton if she became the party &apos;s nomin@@ ee .
a quarter would support her with some res@@ er@@ v@@ ations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nomin@@ ee .
six percent would not support her .
perhaps not sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially likely to be en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ tic about her .
views are more mixed among those not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ tically support her .
while 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ tically back Clinton , fewer Republican voters say that about their fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner , Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open @-@ ended question why they want her to be the nomin@@ ee , the top answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by it &apos;s time for a woman president ( 13 percent ) , and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
also mentioned by Clinton supporters is her association with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
agreement on the issues , and elec@@ t@@ ability are also cited .
as the vice president we@@ igh@@ s a potential run for president , 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him jump in the race - although a third don &apos;t think he should .
when Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party &apos;s nomination , Biden is the top pick .
among Clinton supporters , more than half say Biden would be their second choice , far ahead of S@@ and@@ ers .
if Biden cho@@ os@@ es not to run for the Democratic nomination , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead over S@@ and@@ ers wi@@ den@@ s , from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the running .
fif@@ ty @-@ five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election ; however that figure is down from 78 percent last month .
Biden is a distant second on this measure , but the percentage that sees him as the most elec@@ table has risen .
still , when asked which is more important in a nomin@@ ee , Democratic voters pick issues over elec@@ t@@ ability .
similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nomin@@ ee to these primary voters .
the Democratic candidates , or potential candidates , perform well on some key character@@ isti@@ cs among their party &apos;s primary voters .
maj@@ orities see Clinton , S@@ and@@ ers and Biden as honest and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y and as having strong leadership qu@@ alities .
Biden does the best of the three on hon@@ es@@ ty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is leadership .
thir@@ ty percent of Democratic primary voters don &apos;t think Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y , twice as many as say that about S@@ and@@ ers ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent don &apos;t have an opinion of him on this .
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton , S@@ and@@ ers and Biden as in line with their views ide@@ olo@@ g@@ ically .
on all of these measures , about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of S@@ and@@ ers .
as questions continue about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e@@ mail address and ser@@ ver while Secretary of State , most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her ex@@ plan@@ ation of the matter and say it has@@ n &apos;t imp@@ acted their overall views of her .
but it &apos;s a different story among the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with her ex@@ plan@@ ation , while just about a third are satisfied .
the public &apos;s views on this were split back in March , shortly after the issue came to light .
most Americans say the e@@ mail controversy has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent say their opinion of her has grown worse .
it is mainly Re@@ p@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six in 10 , who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
even though Clinton is viewed as honest and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y by her party &apos;s voters , this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see her as honest and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y , down eight points from last month , and 15 points since May .
six@@ ty @-@ two percent of registered voters don &apos;t think of her as honest and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y .
at the same time , 55 percent of registered voters nationwide don &apos;t see Tr@@ ump as honest and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y either .
both Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good marks on leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Biden , Car@@ son and Bush do the best on hon@@ es@@ ty .
more see S@@ and@@ ers as honest than not , but like Car@@ son , many don &apos;t have an opinion of him .
the margin of er@@ ror for the sa@@ mp@@ le of 3@@ 51 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points .
B@@ en Car@@ son draws close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in national poll
B@@ en Car@@ son is running close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the newest C@@ B@@ S News / New York Times poll
the two candidates account for half the support of voters in the new poll , leaving others sc@@ ro@@ un@@ ging for a fo@@ o@@ th@@ old
Republican voters nationwide continue to back Tr@@ ump in large numbers , clim@@ bing from 23 % support in the last C@@ B@@ S poll , conducted before the Fo@@ x News debate last month , to 27 % in the poll out Tuesday .
but Car@@ son roc@@ ke@@ ted in that same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also found Car@@ son doing well across demographic groups , ed@@ ging out Tr@@ ump among col@@ le@@ ge @-@ educated Republican voters .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and O@@ hi@@ o G@@ ov@@ . John Kas@@ ich , has sli@@ pped behind with W@@ is@@ cons@@ in G@@ ov@@ . S@@ c@@ ot@@ t W@@ al@@ k@@ er falling far@@ th@@ est from 10 % support last month to 2 % now .
former F@@ l@@ ori@@ da G@@ ov@@ . Je@@ b Bush , former Ar@@ k@@ an@@ sa@@ s G@@ ov@@ . Mik@@ e H@@ uc@@ k@@ ab@@ ee and F@@ l@@ ori@@ da Sen@@ . Mar@@ co Ru@@ bi@@ o all tied for third place with 6 % .
the margin of er@@ ror for the 3@@ 76 @-@ person sa@@ mp@@ le of Republican voters in this newest poll is plus @-@ or @-@ min@@ us 6 % , and was conducted S@@ ep@@ t .
the latest CNN / O@@ R@@ C survey , released last week , showed Car@@ son rising in the polls -- lan@@ ding at 19 % support among Re@@ p@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , behind Tr@@ ump &apos;s 32 % support .
the latest poll from AB@@ C News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
facing a rising Car@@ son last week , Tr@@ ump took some pot@@ sh@@ ots at the retired ne@@ ur@@ os@@ ur@@ ge@@ on , even as Car@@ son ap@@ olo@@ gi@@ z@@ ed for questioning Tr@@ ump &apos;s faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tr@@ ump said last Saturday during a campaign stop in I@@ ow@@ a .
five f@@ r@@ ater@@ n@@ ity members charged in death of Bar@@ u@@ ch Col@@ le@@ ge f@@ res@@ h@@ man
nearly two years after a col@@ le@@ ge student died during a f@@ r@@ ater@@ n@@ ity haz@@ ing r@@ itu@@ al in Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia &apos;s Po@@ con@@ o M@@ oun@@ ta@@ in@@ s , murder charges have been filed against five people .
members of New York City &apos;s Bar@@ u@@ ch Col@@ le@@ ge P@@ i Delta P@@ S@@ I f@@ r@@ ater@@ n@@ ity bru@@ t@@ ally assa@@ ulted ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; D@@ en@@ g during an initi@@ ation r@@ ite in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital , contributing to his death , police said .
officials said he was b@@ lin@@ d@@ fol@@ ded , sa@@ d@@ d@@ led with a 30 @-@ p@@ ound back@@ p@@ ack full of s@@ and , and repeatedly t@@ ack@@ led while he tried to walk toward a target across a frozen field .
Mr. D@@ en@@ g eventually complained that his head hurt then fell un@@ con@@ sci@@ ous .
P@@ i Delta P@@ S@@ I f@@ r@@ ater@@ n@@ ity members did not call 9@@ 11 after D@@ en@@ g passed out , and allegedly w@@ ai@@ ted an hour before bringing him to a hospital , police say .
they did , however , find time to change D@@ en@@ g &apos;s clo@@ th@@ es , Google his symp@@ t@@ om@@ s , and contact Andy Men@@ g , the f@@ r@@ ater@@ n@@ ity &apos;s national president to seek advice , Police Chief Ch@@ ri@@ s W@@ ag@@ ner said at a news conference .
&quot; at this point , members began to hide par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and bas@@ ically put the f@@ r@@ ater@@ n@@ ity &apos;s well @-@ being over that of Michael D@@ en@@ g &apos;s , &quot; Chief W@@ ag@@ ner said .
he could not be revi@@ ved and he died the next morning .
according to an aut@@ op@@ sy report , D@@ en@@ g was sub@@ j@@ ected to repeated b@@ lun@@ t force tra@@ um@@ a to his head , tor@@ so , and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families have been dev@@ as@@ ta@@ ted as a result of f@@ r@@ ater@@ n@@ ity haz@@ ing , with at least one student d@@ ying every year from haz@@ ing since 19@@ 70 , &quot; D@@ ou@@ g@@ las Fi@@ er@@ berg , an attorney representing D@@ en@@ g &apos;s family , said in a statement .
Fr@@ ater@@ n@@ ities and their members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is an important one .
a Mon@@ ro@@ e County grand jury recommended third @-@ degree murder charges for the first five members .
thir@@ ty @-@ two other f@@ r@@ ater@@ n@@ ity members , including Mr. Men@@ g , will also be charged with assault haz@@ ing and criminal conspir@@ acy .
&quot; we want to hold not only the individuals involved , but if there &apos;s an organiz@@ ation that san@@ c@@ tioned it , whether officially or un@@ officially , we &apos;re going to hold them accountable as well , &quot; W@@ ag@@ ner said at a news conference Tuesday .
Bar@@ u@@ ch Col@@ le@@ ge banned the f@@ r@@ ater@@ n@@ ity and the national f@@ r@@ ater@@ n@@ ity rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation with the local chapter .
here &apos;s what will happen when the F@@ ed raises interest rates
a rate hike will come and the bul@@ l market will st@@ um@@ ble , bond yi@@ el@@ ds will clim@@ b and the economy will sli@@ p into a recession .
this we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last .
for the economy specifically , history offers little guide about timing .
a recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hike and as long as 86 months .
the Federal Res@@ er@@ ve &apos;s aggres@@ si@@ ven@@ ess in raising rates is often , though not always , a de@@ ter@@ min@@ ant in how the economy and financial assets respond .
that &apos;s why officials at the U@@ .@@ S@@ . central bank have stressed so v@@ ig@@ or@@ ously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory of how long it will take to normal@@ ize .
there are , indeed , multiple vari@@ ab@@ les at play .
in the end , however , market participants may find that all the rate @-@ hike f@@ us@@ s may have been over@@ done .
&quot; the first hike from the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably be interpreted by some as sign@@ aling the end of the era of &apos; cheap money , &apos; &quot; Ju@@ li@@ an J@@ es@@ so@@ p , chief global economist at Capital Economics , said in a note to clients .
in contrast , we do not expect the gra@@ du@@ al return of U@@ .@@ S@@ . interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seis@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
that &apos;s not to say there won &apos;t be effects , however .
here &apos;s a look at how some areas of the economy could react , based on historical trends :
as the market has seen over the past month or so , anti@@ cip@@ ation of rate hikes can make things v@@ ola@@ tile for a while .
once the hike hits , though , the impact is not as dramatic .
&quot; it does seem there is a trend for equ@@ ity returns to st@@ all 12 @-@ 24 months after the first hike , which again perhaps reflects the la@@ g in monetary policy , &quot; Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the F@@ ed hikes .
more specifically , the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up sharply - about 14 percent - heading into the rate hike , fairly flat in the 250 days after ( average gain of 2.@@ 6 percent ) then back to normal once 500 days have passed , with average return in the past six cy@@ c@@ les of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis Bo@@ b d@@ ol@@ l , chief equ@@ ity stra@@ te@@ g@@ ist at N@@ u@@ ve@@ en As@@ set Management , posted on Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche said the impact on sto@@ cks ten@@ ds to get more pron@@ oun@@ ced later in the rate @-@ hi@@ king cycle and returns begin to dimin@@ ish .
rec@@ es@@ sions are a fact of economic life , but rate hikes often help them along .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could has@@ ten a recession .
most notably , gross domestic product will be near its lowest point ever for a F@@ ed rate hike .
according to Deutsche Bank , in the 1@@ 18 rate hikes since 19@@ 50 , only twice has nomin@@ al year over year GDP been below 4.5 percent .
even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.@@ 6 percent , few expect that to last , with the third quarter trac@@ king at just 1.5 percent , according to the At@@ lan@@ ta F@@ ed .
hi@@ king rates into such a fragile economic back@@ drop could be ris@@ k@@ y and set up the question of &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; Deutsche said .
market participants have been br@@ ac@@ ing for a F@@ ed hike all year , with all eyes turned toward this week &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee meeting , which ends Thursday .
while many stra@@ te@@ g@@ ists and economists believe the F@@ O@@ M@@ C could approve a hike at this meeting , f@@ ut@@ ures trading indicates just a 25 percent pro@@ b@@ ability .
&quot; in our study since 19@@ 50 , all hi@@ king cy@@ c@@ les to date have been in a sup@@ er cycle of increasing le@@ ver@@ age with GDP ec@@ li@@ p@@ sing pr@@ er@@ ec@@ es@@ sion pe@@ ak@@ s very quickly post the recovery commen@@ cing , &quot; the report said .
by contrast this has been a uni@@ qu@@ ely slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the sa@@ mp@@ le period .
the current cycle is by far the longest the F@@ ed has w@@ ai@@ ted since the end of the last recession ; the record had been 35 months , and this is 74 months and counting .
fixed income also has been v@@ ola@@ tile as the market anti@@ cip@@ ates a rate hike , and the pat@@ ter@@ n is somewhat similar to what equ@@ ities experience .
the principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than sto@@ cks when the F@@ ed changes course in policy .
for bonds , it does seem yi@@ el@@ ds change direction immediately as the first hike / cut in the cycle arrives .
at the end of the hi@@ king cycle bond yi@@ el@@ ds fall immediately , &quot; Deutsche said .
Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b stra@@ te@@ g@@ ists believe the hike in rates will cause yi@@ el@@ ds between l@@ on@@ ger@@ - and sh@@ or@@ ter @-@ dated bonds to move closer together , f@@ lat@@ ten@@ ing the cur@@ ve .
high @-@ yield bonds often perform better in such a climate , though &quot; we are still cautious about st@@ re@@ t@@ ching for yield , &quot; K@@ ath@@ y Jones , fixed income analyst at Sch@@ wa@@ b , said in an analysis .
inter@@ est@@ ingly , Jones thinks markets already have adap@@ ted to F@@ ed policy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength in the d@@ ol@@ lar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are several signs that the market has ad@@ j@@ us@@ ted to the prospect of tigh@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; she wrote .
short @-@ term interest rates are up , the yield cur@@ ve is f@@ latter , credit sp@@ reads have wi@@ den@@ ed and v@@ ola@@ ti@@ li@@ ty has increased - all character@@ isti@@ cs of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens policy .
bro@@ ad@@ ly speaking , companies that do the majority of their business in the U@@ .@@ S@@ . will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
mul@@ tin@@ ation@@ als with l@@ ots of debt will fare worse , as a rising d@@ ol@@ lar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive the finance .
&quot; history shows that &apos; quality &apos; sto@@ cks tend to out@@ perform during the three months following an initial rate hike , &quot; G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s analysts said in a report for clients .
firms with strong balance she@@ ets out@@ p@@ ac@@ ed weak balance she@@ et companies following each of the 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 rate hikes , by an average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high returns on capital as well as low v@@ ola@@ ti@@ li@@ ty sto@@ cks also out@@ performed their lower quality counterparts , by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) , respectively .
debt will become a big issue .
companies with a high percentage of flo@@ ating rate debt stand to lose the most , G@@ ol@@ d@@ man said .
outside p@@ ure stock plays , consumers stand to benefit as well through the rising d@@ ol@@ lar .
sa@@ vers could see gains as well through higher yi@@ el@@ ds at the , though experts differ on how quickly that will take hold .
BBC Radio 3 is a cop@@ y of C@@ las@@ sic F@@ M says MP An@@ drew B@@ ing@@ ham
conservative MP An@@ drew B@@ ing@@ ham criticised station for &apos; d@@ um@@ b@@ ing down@@ &apos;
argues it &apos;s becoming increasingly in@@ dist@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ ha@@ ble from commercial rival
also took aim at the BBC Music A@@ wards , saying they just ri@@ p off the Br@@ its
col@@ le@@ ag@@ ue Dam@@ i@@ en Col@@ lin@@ s MP attacked The Voice , saying that too wasn &apos;t original
BBC Radio 3 is &quot; turning into &quot; C@@ las@@ sic F@@ M , a leading MP has claimed , pil@@ ing fresh pressure on the broadcaster to prove that it does something that commercial broadcas@@ ters do not .
conservative MP An@@ drew B@@ ing@@ ham also told BBC bos@@ ses that the public service radio station appeared to be &quot; d@@ um@@ b@@ ing down &quot; and is becoming increasingly in@@ dist@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ ha@@ ble from its commercial rival .
&quot; Radio 3 seems to be - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; d@@ um@@ b@@ ing down &quot; - but it seems to be turning into C@@ las@@ sic F@@ M , &quot; he said .
he also took aim at the BBC Music A@@ wards , launched last December .
the BBC Music A@@ wards which started last year seem to be the Br@@ its by another name .
so , if you &apos;re trying to do something different - those are two examples from the top of my head where you &apos;re actually just m@@ im@@ ic@@ king what is already on the market , &quot; M@@ r B@@ ing@@ ham said .
BBC director general denied the charges , arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I am not going to learn about cl@@ as@@ si@@ cal music from anywhere else .
and it &apos;s commitment to live music and music making is actually second to none .
&quot; and also , Radio 3 &apos;s commitment to finding new music and com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ing new works I think is also really important , &quot; he said .
earlier this year , BBC Radio 3 contr@@ ol@@ ler Al@@ an D@@ av@@ ey argued that it has to work harder to engage audiences than it did in the past , because Br@@ it@@ ons are less educated about cl@@ as@@ si@@ cal music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC &apos;s output which came under fire for t@@ reading on the to@@ es of commercial rivals , during the Culture , Media and S@@ port selec@@ t committee hearing .
T@@ ory MP Dam@@ i@@ en Col@@ lin@@ s attacked The Voice - the musical tal@@ ent show which the BBC bought in from Dutch producer Tal@@ p@@ a Media at an estimated cost of Â£ 2@@ 2@@ million .
can you see why that programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinc@@ tive ?
L@@ or@@ d Hall insisted that the B@@ B@@ C@@ 1 show - which stars Pal@@ om@@ a F@@ a@@ it@@ h and boy George as judges - was produced &quot; in a particularly BBC way . &quot;
he added that he wants the Corporation to &quot; find a hit from our own in @-@ house stable &quot; next time it launches an entertainment series .
however , he refused to rule out or@@ dering more series of The Voice in the future , or spending lic@@ ence fee p@@ ay@@ ers &apos; money on other entertainment for@@ ma@@ ts .

&apos;@@ I@@ f you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000 , it was always going to ration@@ alise over time , &apos; Andy Mul@@ ca@@ h@@ y , editor of IM@@ R@@ G sales index , told the Guardian .
he explained that online sales were bol@@ ster@@ ed three years ago when sh@@ op@@ pers started using their mobile phones to make pur@@ ch@@ ases .
it meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different con@@ tex@@ ts , such as on the SO@@ F@@ A .
but now that is pla@@ te@@ au@@ ing a bit , you might see ( growth ) fall away .
the Black Friday phenomenon , which has been imported from America , is being cited as one of the reasons behind the s@@ lo@@ w@@ ing sales .
experts believe sh@@ op@@ pers could be holding off making pur@@ ch@@ ases ahead of the event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year five times the average number of sh@@ op@@ pers f@@ locked to their computers to snap up deals cr@@ ash@@ ing a number of re@@ ta@@ il@@ ers websites .
experts believe Black Friday , which saw sh@@ op@@ pers fight over bar@@ gains , could be holding sh@@ op@@ pers off from making pur@@ ch@@ ases
research published by the British R@@ et@@ ail Con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um found just over Â£ 1 in every Â£ 5 was being spent online .
for some products , such as T@@ V@@ s and w@@ ash@@ ing ma@@ ch@@ ines , more than one third of pur@@ ch@@ ases are now done through web stores .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people are buying clo@@ th@@ es and sho@@ es online , rather than using high street fashion cha@@ ins .
Muslims bur@@ y those killed in me@@ c@@ ca cr@@ ane crash as B@@ in Laden family san@@ c@@ tioned
bodies of 29 of the dead carried through the streets by Muslims as the first fun@@ er@@ als take place in me@@ c@@ ca

the Health Ministry said a total of 3@@ 9@@ 4 people were also injured after the cr@@ ane cr@@ as@@ hed down
carried al@@ of@@ t through the streets , hundreds of Muslims gathered to bur@@ y 29 of the victims killed when a cr@@ ane collapsed at me@@ c@@ ca &apos;s Grand mosque .
d@@ res@@ sed largely in white , mo@@ ur@@ ners packed the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ is@@ se@@ m ce@@ me@@ tery .
the sa@@ d possession passed by the hol@@ y site , where just days earlier a construction cr@@ ane cr@@ as@@ hed through the ce@@ iling of the mosque and top@@ pled onto wor@@ ship@@ ers .
the bodies were released for funeral as the Saudi King san@@ c@@ tioned the B@@ in Laden family construction group over the disaster , which also left 3@@ 9@@ 4 injured .
the bodies of 29 of the wor@@ ship@@ ers killed when a cr@@ ane cr@@ as@@ hed collapsed at me@@ c@@ ca &apos;s Grand Central Mos@@ que were carried through the streets
among the dead was father @-@ of @-@ four Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ra@@ m , from B@@ ol@@ ton , Gre@@ a@@ ter Man@@ ch@@ es@@ ter , who was on his first pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge when the cr@@ ane cr@@ as@@ hed down .
M@@ r Ak@@ ra@@ m had been in the Grand Mos@@ que with his parents ahead of the start of the annual ha@@ j@@ j pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge .
Saudi officials have already vowed that the ha@@ j@@ j to me@@ c@@ ca will go ahead with thousands continuing to des@@ c@@ end on the city .
today , King Sal@@ man said the B@@ in@@ la@@ din Group should not have left the cr@@ ane &apos;s arm up when it was not in use .
an Ara@@ bic version of the decree , carried by the state @-@ run Saudi Press Agency , said the B@@ in@@ la@@ din Group was partly to blame for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English service did not report that de@@ ta@@ il , but did say leaders of the company have been banned from travelling abroad .
earlier this week Sal@@ man vowed to reveal what caused the cr@@ ane to top@@ ple into a cour@@ t@@ yard of the Grand Mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have con@@ ver@@ ged ahead of the ha@@ j@@ j pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge later this month .
B@@ in@@ la@@ din Group has not released any statements about the cr@@ ane collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment .
the ro@@ y@@ al decree also blamed the group for not using up @-@ to @-@ date safety measures and failing to co@@ ordinate with me@@ te@@ or@@ ological officials .

al Q@@ ai@@ da &apos;s late leader O@@ sa@@ ma bin Laden was a ren@@ eg@@ ade son dis@@ owned by the family in the 1990s .
the crash came amid high win@@ ds and rain just days before millions arrive in the k@@ ing@@ dom for the pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge , which is required at least once in the life of every able @-@ bo@@ died Muslim .
officials said 15@@ 8 people remain in hospital .
officials ordered one million ri@@ y@@ als ( Â£ 17@@ 4,000 ) be paid to the relatives of those killed , and the same amount to those per@@ man@@ ently injured .
others injured will receive half that amount .
B &amp; Q bos@@ s says Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men working cheap is behind trend
Br@@ it@@ ons are increasingly emplo@@ ying hand@@ y@@ men says Ver@@ on@@ i@@ que La@@ ur@@ y
number of s@@ killed tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe behind rise
resulting in 200 more S@@ cre@@ w@@ fix stores , aimed at tra@@ des@@ men , opening
at same time K@@ ing@@ f@@ is@@ her is closing 60 B &amp; Q outlets across the country
by Ru@@ per@@ t Steiner , Chief City Cor@@ respon@@ dent for the Daily Mail
Br@@ it@@ ons are said to be putting down their ham@@ mers and pain@@ t@@ br@@ us@@ hes in favour of emplo@@ ying s@@ killed Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men to carry out work in their home
if you are hand@@ y with a ham@@ mer or a wh@@ iz@@ z at pain@@ ting walls , it seems you are in the minority these days .
because Br@@ it@@ ons are increasingly emplo@@ ying hand@@ y@@ men to carry out DI@@ Y jobs in their homes , according to the bos@@ s of the company behind B &amp; Q@@ .
Ver@@ on@@ i@@ que La@@ ur@@ y , new chief executive of K@@ ing@@ f@@ is@@ her , which owns the home improvement chain , said a big rise in the number of s@@ killed tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe offering services at rock @-@ bottom prices is behind the trend .
as a result , K@@ ing@@ f@@ is@@ her is planning to open 200 more S@@ cre@@ w@@ fix stores , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ men , while closing 60 B &amp; Q outlets .
M@@ r@@ s La@@ ur@@ y said she wants more women to be employed in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in store are made by the fa@@ i@@ rer sex .
currently the majority of staff are men .
she said there was a need to address growing demographic trends which have seen more single female households who are doing more home improvements than in the past .
M@@ r@@ s La@@ ur@@ y said : &quot; we still have a majority of men working in our stores .
we need to move more towards a balance .
fun@@ da@@ mentally half of our customers are female with 80 per cent of the decisions over items purchased taken by women .
women play a big part in the decision @-@ making process .
M@@ r@@ s La@@ ur@@ y , who is one of only five women at the helm of Britain &apos;s F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 index of leading firms , has also re@@ struc@@ tured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women directors .
K@@ ing@@ f@@ is@@ her is almost alone in having exactly 50 per cent of its team st@@ aff@@ ed by women , including its chief executive and finance director .
M@@ r@@ s La@@ ur@@ y said : &quot; this was a con@@ sci@@ ous decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it has not been difficult to find good women to put on our board .
K@@ ing@@ f@@ is@@ her posted a fall in both half @-@ year profit and sales after the group sho@@ ul@@ dered the cost of sh@@ ut@@ ting stores .
as a result of the trend K@@ ing@@ f@@ is@@ her , which owns S@@ cre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , is opening 200 new stores
decision time on interest rates for US Federal Res@@ er@@ ve
the world is watching as the US Federal Res@@ er@@ ve meets over two days on Wednesday and Thursday , to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade .
a survey of 80 economists pol@@ led by Reuters found a little over half who only last week thought the F@@ ed would go for it , now think it will hold fire a bit longer and keep rates at the current 0 @-@ 0.@@ 25 percent range .
it &apos;s a historical event because it &apos;s been seven years since the F@@ ed cut rates to zero .
for the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start a process of normal@@ ization of interest rates , &quot; said An@@ gel U@@ bi@@ de , senior fellow at the Pet@@ er@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy has been performing relatively well , the recovery adding tr@@ il@@ li@@ ons of dollars to the balance she@@ et and gener@@ ating little inflation .
however the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y global outlook .
it has warned markets to be ready for a hike but indi@@ c@@ ations are they also believe the odds are against such a move .
the decision is due to be announced at 20@@ .@@ 0@@ 0 CE@@ T on Thursday .
Delta State University sho@@ o@@ ter left note of ap@@ ology
after shooting and killing his g@@ ir@@ l@@ friend in Mis@@ s@@ is@@ si@@ p@@ p@@ i on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his col@@ le@@ ag@@ ue later that day - S@@ han@@ non lam@@ b wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sor@@ ry &quot; for the first murder and w@@ ished he &quot; could take it back , &quot; authorities revealed Tuesday .
police in G@@ au@@ ti@@ er , Mis@@ s@@ . said lam@@ b , a geo@@ graphy and social science education instruc@@ tor at Delta State University , called 9@@ 11 around 10 a@@ .@@ m@@ .
Monday and said he had shot and killed someone .
lam@@ b told the dis@@ pat@@ cher that police needed to send officers over to his home .
he said &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; and also mentioned that there is a &quot; swe@@ et do@@ g &quot; in the house that is &quot; not going to bo@@ ther anyone &quot; but is likely up@@ set .
police asked the cal@@ ler his name , but he didn &apos;t give it .
lam@@ b did not provide an ex@@ plan@@ ation for the shooting .
when police got to the scene they found the body of A@@ my P@@ ren@@ ti@@ s@@ s , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from lam@@ b , 45 , that said : &quot; I am so sor@@ ry I wish I could take it back .
I lov@@ ed A@@ my and she is the only person who ever lov@@ ed me .
after writing the note , lam@@ b dro@@ ve 300 mil@@ es to Delta State where he killed E@@ than Sch@@ mid@@ t , a history professor , before eventually taking his own life late Monday as c@@ op@@ s closed in .
University President W@@ il@@ li@@ am La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know of any conflict between lam@@ b and Sch@@ mid@@ t but &quot; obviously there was something in Mr. lam@@ b &apos;s mind . &quot;
despite reports Monday that lam@@ b allegedly believed P@@ ren@@ ti@@ s@@ s was also ro@@ man@@ tically involved with Sch@@ mid@@ t , authorities said Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; of a &quot; love tri@@ an@@ g@@ le . &quot;
P@@ ren@@ ti@@ s@@ s was described as a &quot; good person &quot; by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said he had been married to her for about seven years .
the two di@@ v@@ or@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and P@@ ren@@ ti@@ s@@ s had a daughter , who is 19 , and she was &quot; dev@@ as@@ ta@@ ted . &quot;
he said P@@ ren@@ ti@@ s@@ s and her daughter were &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
P@@ ren@@ ti@@ s@@ s worked an online job from her home , according to L@@ ins@@ day K@@ no@@ w@@ les , identified as a close friend of P@@ ren@@ ti@@ s@@ s by the S@@ un Herald .
K@@ no@@ w@@ les said P@@ ren@@ ti@@ s@@ s , who had a ho@@ un@@ d do@@ g named L@@ igh@@ t@@ ning , had been dating lam@@ b for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; K@@ no@@ w@@ les said .
police said lam@@ b had ph@@ oned relatives at some point Monday to tell them &quot; he &apos;s not going to jail . &quot;
when c@@ op@@ s caught up with him on H@@ igh@@ way 1 near Gre@@ en@@ v@@ il@@ le later that night , lam@@ b pul@@ led his car over , b@@ ail@@ ed out on fo@@ ot , ran into the wo@@ ods and shot and killed himself .
lam@@ b received a do@@ c@@ tor@@ ate in education from Delta State in the spring of 2015 , according to his resume posted on the university &apos;s website .

the actor has also reportedly st@@ ru@@ g@@ g@@ led with drugs , and in 2008 , he was b@@ usted for drug possession .
all that stu@@ ff sure does take a toll .
Man@@ ch@@ es@@ ter United &apos;s L@@ uk@@ e Sha@@ w out for months with double frac@@ ture
L@@ uk@@ e Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg during Man@@ ch@@ es@@ ter United &apos;s Cha@@ mp@@ ions League defeat at P@@ S@@ V E@@ in@@ d@@ h@@ ov@@ en .
while this left the full @-@ back in te@@ ars and will rule him out for at least six months , L@@ ou@@ is van G@@ a@@ al remains hopeful Sha@@ w could play again this season .
the in@@ j@@ ur@@ y was caused by a rec@@ k@@ less tackle from H@@ Ã©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ en@@ o in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had bur@@ st into the P@@ S@@ V area .
he had nine minutes of treatment on the p@@ it@@ ch and required o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en before being taken to hospital .
van G@@ a@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Man@@ ch@@ es@@ ter .
it is aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Man@@ ch@@ es@@ ter United at 18 , has it very difficult and then plays fan@@ tas@@ tically and then this happens .
when it was in the d@@ res@@ sing room he had an o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en mas@@ k on .
he was cr@@ ying .
I am not a doctor but when you have a double frac@@ ture it is six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play again this season .
Mor@@ en@@ o appeared fortun@@ ate to escape a red card and the concession of a spot @-@ kick .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ ol@@ i , the refer@@ ee , did not pen@@ alise the M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an .
van G@@ a@@ al suggested the Italian official had er@@ red .
you can judge for yo@@ ur@@ self when I say it is a penalty and a red card .
it was a very bad tackle with two leg@@ s .
a t@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ w &apos;s account read : &quot; thank you everyone for your messages , words can &apos;t describe how g@@ ut@@ ted I am , my road to recovery starts now , I will come back stronger . &quot;

it is never the intention of our players to in@@ j@@ ure an opponent .

&quot; he finds it very difficult because the intention was not to in@@ j@@ ure the opponent , and when you hear it is a very bad in@@ j@@ ur@@ y , it &apos;s not good , &quot; Co@@ cu said .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was heading in a different direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ en@@ o &#93; touched it , but I couldn &apos;t see the tackle on L@@ uk@@ e .
speaking to S@@ B@@ S@@ 6 , Mor@@ en@@ o said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult such a thing can be .
I feel very bad about it , I am so sor@@ ry .

su@@ rely David Cam@@ er@@ on knows The L@@ or@@ a@@ x better than this ?
it &apos;s one thing any par@@ ent soon le@@ ar@@ ns : when your child lov@@ es a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it almost by heart .
unless , it seems , you are David Cam@@ er@@ on .
asked by a provider of holiday ch@@ ild@@ care sch@@ e@@ mes to name his favourite kids &apos; book , the prime minister op@@ ted for The L@@ or@@ a@@ x , the 197@@ 1 environmental f@@ able by Dr Se@@ us@@ s .
it was a difficult choice , Cam@@ er@@ on writes in a message published on the website of the Su@@ per@@ C@@ amp@@ s company , continuing : &quot; fun@@ ny , moving , cre@@ ative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s one I enjoy reading to my children because there always seems to be an image or a message that we have previously missed . &quot;
all very well , except that the subsequent par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h in which Cam@@ er@@ on sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly describes the plot of the book instead gives a pr@@ Ã©@@ c@@ is of the 2012 film version , which added new char@@ ac@@ ters and de@@ ta@@ il to p@@ ad out the fairly brief original text .
&quot; set in the w@@ al@@ led city of Th@@ need @-@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , Au@@ dre@@ y , by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree , &quot; it reads , chron@@ ic@@ ling a love interest unknown to Dr Se@@ us@@ s , real name The@@ od@@ or Se@@ us@@ s Ge@@ is@@ el , who died in 1991 .
if that wasn &apos;t suspicious enough , Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s submitted text reads in part like a plot sum@@ m@@ ary of the L@@ or@@ a@@ x film provided on the Internet M@@ ov@@ ie database website , which begins : &quot; in the w@@ al@@ led city of Th@@ need @-@ Vil@@ le , where everything is arti@@ fic@@ ial and even the air is a com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , Au@@ dre@@ y . &quot;
given he is an av@@ ow@@ ed@@ ly hands @-@ on par@@ ent , it seems unlikely Cam@@ er@@ on is so un@@ familiar with the book &apos;s plot , in which a young un@@ named boy he@@ ars how the local environment was dev@@ as@@ ta@@ ted by the av@@ ar@@ ic@@ ious , tree @-@ ch@@ op@@ ping , th@@ need @-@ k@@ n@@ it@@ ting On@@ ce @-@ ler , despite the protests of the ep@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous L@@ or@@ a@@ x , a squ@@ at , m@@ ou@@ st@@ ac@@ hi@@ o@@ ed cre@@ ature who &quot; speaks for the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively lo@@ w@@ ly P@@ R task would have been out@@ so@@ ur@@ ced to an ai@@ de , se@@ em@@ ingly one who has never read The L@@ or@@ a@@ x 20 times in a row to a child .
a Do@@ w@@ ning Street spokeswoman said the text was believed to have come from Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s constitu@@ ency office .

A@@ dam L@@ y@@ th was clearly at risk of England om@@ is@@ sion but it &apos;s still tough
taking on Pakistan in the United Arab E@@ mi@@ rates is a tough as@@ sign@@ ment but after seeing the squ@@ ad England have selected for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 T@@ est series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me .
I wouldn &apos;t rule out an away win , either .
Al@@ as@@ ta@@ ir Co@@ ok &apos;s side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of sp@@ in in that bat@@ ting lin@@ e@@ up and the collective min@@ d@@ set is strong ; they will not carry sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a y@@ ou@@ th@@ ful positi@@ v@@ ity .

related : A@@ dam L@@ y@@ th dropped from England T@@ est squ@@ ad and replaced by A@@ le@@ x Hal@@ es
the decision to om@@ it A@@ dam L@@ y@@ th is obviously a tough one for me to analy@@ se as his head coach at Y@@ or@@ k@@ sh@@ ire .
his seven T@@ es@@ ts have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cri@@ c@@ k@@ et@@ ers are ju@@ dged on output .
there were no question marks over Jo@@ e Ro@@ ot , for example , leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selec@@ tors .
a couple of half @-@ centuries and L@@ y@@ th might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own dest@@ in@@ y .
hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly if he pun@@ ches out more runs for Y@@ or@@ k@@ sh@@ ire another opportunity will come along .
the England head coach , T@@ rev@@ or B@@ ay@@ lis@@ s , praised his attitude even when he was not performing as well as he can and that does not surprise me ; he is a team man above all else .
the question of how long a T@@ est bat@@ s@@ man gets to make his mark is a tough one .
L@@ y@@ th got seven cap@@ s - like S@@ am R@@ ob@@ son before him - while Nic@@ k Com@@ p@@ ton got nine .
only Com@@ p@@ ton got the chance home and away .
the only gri@@ pe you could have was that England went for J@@ on@@ a@@ than Tr@@ ot@@ t in the Car@@ i@@ b@@ be@@ an first - when L@@ y@@ th was in top form - but that was@@ ted opportunity is in the past now .
A@@ le@@ x Hal@@ es comes in and he is a bat@@ s@@ man I rate highly .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ c@@ ke@@ ter , which we at Y@@ or@@ k@@ sh@@ ire saw early this season when he made 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge p@@ it@@ ch that was doing a bit .
he must at least be af@@ for@@ ded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the make @-@ up of the side in the U@@ A@@ E .
the idea of Mo@@ e@@ en opening the bat@@ ting alongside Co@@ ok , which would get the extra sp@@ in@@ ner in while keeping four qu@@ ic@@ ks , has been flo@@ ated and it is not something I am against .
I don &apos;t see why a st@@ ro@@ k@@ em@@ aker cannot b@@ at there and this left @-@ han@@ der has already shown he is one hel@@ l of a cri@@ c@@ ke@@ ter .
Mo@@ e@@ en may not have done the job for his county , Wor@@ ces@@ ter@@ sh@@ ire , but he has been a No@@ 3 for them and there is not much difference .
my old team @-@ M@@ ate J@@ us@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 T@@ es@@ ts at first drop before stepping up to open in 2001 .
he pe@@ eled off three centuries immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar An@@ s@@ ari comes into the squ@@ ad as back @-@ up sp@@ in@@ ner and , in my limited deal@@ ings with him , he has struck me as very impressive young man .
people may look at his ra@@ w st@@ at@@ s - aver@@ aging 31 with the b@@ at and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t but there are not a he@@ ap of sp@@ in@@ ners putting their hands up and selec@@ tors have op@@ ted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
away from the squ@@ ad , England look to have made a couple of sh@@ re@@ w@@ d addi@@ tions to their co@@ ac@@ hing staff .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ a@@ war@@ den@@ e , the S@@ ri Lan@@ ka bat@@ s@@ man , as a consul@@ tan@@ t for the T@@ est matches could be a mas@@ ter@@ st@@ ro@@ ke .
he is one of the game &apos;s lov@@ eli@@ est blo@@ k@@ es , who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ l@@ ing@@ wood comes in for the white @-@ ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ru@@ th@@ less st@@ re@@ ak into the set@@ up .
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cri@@ c@@ ket , be it playing or co@@ ac@@ hing , and like Mah@@ ela has n@@ ous that can be tapped .
sometimes new voices in the d@@ res@@ sing room , even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before , can f@@ res@@ h@@ en up a side .
Col@@ ly &apos;s Dur@@ ham team @-@ M@@ ate B@@ en st@@ ok@@ es is res@@ ted for the one @-@ day@@ ers , Ro@@ ot was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no issue with this .
while not everyone will agree , the co@@ ach@@ es and selec@@ tors do not set the schedule .
and you have to remember , like players , their jobs are dependent on results .
such decisions are never taken ligh@@ tly .

my European PA@@ L , who wants an ou@@ tw@@ ard @-@ looking Britain inside the EU t@@ ent - &quot; D@@ on &apos;t leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - suggests that more short @-@ si@@ gh@@ ted ministers and officials in some capitals have got to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or leave .
Angela Merkel , Germany &apos;s ca@@ u@@ ti@@ ously level @-@ headed chan@@ cel@@ l@@ or , is an ally , but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her , as it did for over@@ st@@ ay@@ ers T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ r@@ and ( 14 ) and Ko@@ h@@ l ( 16 ) .

it &apos;s hard to see them breaking a leg to help the Sel@@ fi@@ e Br@@ its , whose energy might be better spent preventing S@@ c@@ ot@@ land leaving the UK - something they don &apos;t want either because most have similar separatist ten@@ den@@ cies .

for all his fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ness E@@ d Mil@@ i@@ b@@ and knew who his en@@ em@@ ies were .
they included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ sh@@ y ras@@ c@@ als , phone @-@ h@@ ac@@ king foreigners and p@@ se@@ u@@ do non @-@ d@@ om@@ s who own most of our great newspapers .
actually Tony Blair thought much the same about them , but realised that when you &apos;re in a c@@ age with a R@@ and@@ y g@@ or@@ il@@ la you have to pass the ban@@ an@@ as to dist@@ r@@ act it from having you for lun@@ ch and again for te@@ a .
in fact Mil@@ i@@ b@@ and was more Bla@@ ir@@ ite than Blair in opposing Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s referendum wh@@ e@@ e@@ ze , since Blair had conce@@ ded the principle over the EU &apos;s ab@@ or@@ ted constitution , sun@@ k by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a get @-@ out card .
the press never for@@ gave him that either .
but n@@ ice J@@ er@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly p@@ at on the back at W@@ est@@ min@@ s@@ ter on Monday - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re @-@ adopting Ne@@ il K@@ in@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boycott Mur@@ do@@ ch strategy of the 8@@ 0s , a mistake then and now .
it may take time , but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to engage with the media , not with me , but certainly with An@@ drew Mar@@ r whose BBC SO@@ F@@ A he vac@@ ated on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is what I will kin@@ dly call evol@@ ving .
he says he &apos;d like us to stay in a refor@@ med EU .
well , most people outside U@@ k@@ ip &apos;s wo@@ ad @-@ wearing ten@@ den@@ cy and the w@@ il@@ der sho@@ res of T@@ ory little En@@ g@@ lan@@ der@@ ism can probably say yes to that .
it &apos;s what H@@ il@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not a Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n said on radio and TV this week as the boy S@@ c@@ out in him st@@ ru@@ g@@ g@@ led not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of ab@@ r@@ asi@@ ve John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell as shadow chan@@ cel@@ l@@ or was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 7@@ 0s , when his old da@@ d st@@ ru@@ g@@ g@@ led on TV to be dis@@ lo@@ y@@ al to Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
H@@ il@@ ary &apos;s struggle was more attractive .
but fighting to stay in &quot; in all circumstances &quot; - Ben@@ n &apos;s ph@@ r@@ ase - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was saying , nor what J@@ C told pe@@ ers and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night , by all accounts .
whatever the bottom @-@ up , tou@@ ch@@ y @-@ fe@@ ely image Cor@@ by@@ n wants to con@@ v@@ ey - remember , he even touched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 24 / 7 TV and especially in the ma@@ el@@ st@@ ro@@ m that is social media , a hot@@ bed of par@@ an@@ o@@ ia and bet@@ r@@ ay@@ al .
it &apos;s fair enough not to give Cam@@ er@@ on a free pass on Europe , allowing him to take Labour &apos;s support for granted in the referendum campaign , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell has said .
Sim@@ on J@@ en@@ k@@ ins certainly thinks so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic equ@@ ivo@@ cation about EU membership - consistent with their Ben@@ n@@ ite siege economy , anti @-@ capit@@ alist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic discussion among le@@ f@@ tw@@ ing dis@@ si@@ dents for whom the n@@ ar@@ c@@ is@@ s@@ ism of small difference is a central T@@ en@@ et of do@@ c@@ tr@@ in@@ al squ@@ ab@@ bles .
as with his equ@@ ivo@@ cation over N@@ a@@ to - T@@ om W@@ at@@ son is ada@@ man@@ t that J@@ C won &apos;t campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their mas@@ ters at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on concessions to Britain when it may all be po@@ in@@ t@@ less ?
the US is already pre@@ t@@ ty disappointed with the Br@@ its &quot; fe@@ e@@ ble military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost @-@ cutting T@@ ory government in power , as I was reminded at the launch of something called the British Inf@@ lu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England e @-@ cigarettes review
claims by a government @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are 95 % less harmful than smoking ar@@ ose from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers have said .
experts writing in the British Medi@@ cal Journal ( B@@ M@@ J ) joined the Lan@@ c@@ et in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ H@@ E ) in its report on e @-@ cigarettes .
P@@ H@@ E published the &quot; landmark &quot; report last month , describing it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but several researchers have questioned the ro@@ bu@@ st@@ ness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the Lan@@ c@@ et medical jo@@ ur@@ n@@ al last month attacked the &quot; ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily f@@ li@@ m@@ sy foundation &quot; on which P@@ H@@ E based its main conclusion .
writing in the B@@ M@@ J , two further researchers have questioned whether the claims were &quot; built on rock or s@@ and . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ e@@ e , professor of European public health at the London School of Hy@@ gi@@ ene and Tro@@ p@@ ical Medi@@ c@@ ine , and Sim@@ on Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of cl@@ in@@ ical ep@@ i@@ de@@ m@@ i@@ ology at the University of Li@@ ver@@ pool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said the public would expect P@@ H@@ E &apos;s claims that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; would be based on a detailed review of evidence and mo@@ del@@ ling .
in fact , it comes from a single meeting of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( M@@ C@@ D@@ A ) model to syn@@ th@@ es@@ ise their opinions on the har@@ ms associated with different n@@ ic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research paper .
Mc@@ K@@ e@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said one sp@@ on@@ s@@ or of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American T@@ ob@@ ac@@ co for an independent study .
he also endorsed B@@ A@@ T &apos;s public health cre@@ denti@@ als in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ri@@ s International , they added .
the ration@@ ale for selec@@ ting the members of the panel is not provided , but they include several known e @-@ cigarette cha@@ mp@@ ions , some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper .
some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at P@@ H@@ E .
the research paper produced by the group &quot; tel@@ l@@ ingly conce@@ des &quot; there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the har@@ ms of most products on most of the criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ e@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote .
however , none of these links or li@@ mit@@ ations are discussed in the P@@ H@@ E report .
Mc@@ K@@ e@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said P@@ H@@ E &apos;s claims that &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; were pre@@ mature .
Pr@@ of K@@ ev@@ in F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and wel@@ l@@ being at P@@ H@@ E , said the claims in the B@@ M@@ J had been responded to before .
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking . &quot;
one in two lif@@ el@@ ong smokers di@@ es from their addi@@ ction .
all of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e @-@ cigarettes are small by comparison , but we must continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ H@@ E has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show , especially when there was so much public conf@@ u@@ sion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people a year die of a smoking @-@ related ill@@ ness and smoking costs the N@@ H@@ S Â£ 2@@ b@@ n a year .
by sp@@ elling out clearly the current evidence - that while e @-@ cigarettes are not risk @-@ free , they carry only a frac@@ tion of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national re@@ m@@ it .
BBC should give up E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders , says former C@@ han@@ ne@@ l 4 chief
the former C@@ han@@ ne@@ l 4 chairman L@@ uk@@ e Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders and The Voice , saying its commercial rivals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows such as the Albert Square so@@ ap .
Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son said the lic@@ ence fee should only be used to make the sort of programmes that are not made by other UK broadcas@@ ters .
he criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes likely to be watched by a smaller audience in tough sl@@ ots against its rivals &quot; biggest rating shows , and on channels such as B@@ B@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC &apos;s director general , Tony Hall , said the cor@@ por@@ ation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son said he had tried for six years in his time at C@@ han@@ ne@@ l 4 to do a ti@@ e @-@ up with the BBC without success .
&quot; I do struggle with the idea that the BBC com@@ missions and broadcas@@ ts programmes that would clearly be shown by un@@ sub@@ si@@ dis@@ ed rivals , &quot; Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son told the House of L@@ or@@ ds communication committee , as part of its in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y into the future of the BBC .
if you keep the lic@@ ence fee , which I &apos;m not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea , it should reduce its output at least to programmes that others ar@@ en &apos;t making and com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ing .
they broadcast The Voice in a prime s@@ lot because they want to gain as broad a support as possible for its future .
the idea that no one else would show that is a j@@ oke , it &apos;s lu@@ dic@@ ro@@ us , it &apos;s obviously non@@ sense .
Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without sub@@ si@@ dy .
the Voice is one , E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mit@@ te@@ d@@ ly made in @-@ house .
fran@@ k@@ ly other channels would give their right arm for it .
I struggle to see how it &apos;s public service broadcasting .
I don &apos;t think that would dimin@@ ish the BBC at all .
Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son , a ser@@ ial ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur who led C@@ han@@ ne@@ l 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC was guilty of ch@@ as@@ ing ratings &quot; because of the ambitions of people who work there , and because they believe that is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments about the BBC &apos;s most popular shows ech@@ o those of former Sk@@ y executive Tony B@@ all , who used his Mac@@ T@@ ag@@ gar@@ t lec@@ ture in E@@ din@@ bur@@ g@@ h in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell off shows such as E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders .
Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son said the BBC &apos;s more n@@ ic@@ he public service programmes &quot; go on to B@@ B@@ C@@ 4 where quite often you can &apos;t measure the audience but they fulfil their re@@ m@@ it and they can argue when they go on their san@@ c@@ ti@@ mon@@ ious missions about j@@ us@@ tif@@ ying Â£ 4@@ b@@ n in lic@@ ence fee income , &quot; Wel@@ l of course , we do all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programmes that no one watched . &quot;
they put them on a s@@ lot where no one was ever going to watch them .
on the lic@@ ence fee , Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son told the committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of who gets the best value from it .
of course you all think , we all think , Â£ 150 a year is great value , but for people for whom Â£ 150 is a lot of money I won@@ der if they do because they don &apos;t con@@ sum@@ e a lot of the BBC .
former Sk@@ y and C@@ han@@ ne@@ l 5 executive David El@@ ste@@ in , who also gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday , said the BBC should re@@ vis@@ e its Re@@ i@@ th@@ ian mission to &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and en@@ ter@@ tain . &quot;
he said little of the BBC &apos;s output was now formally classified as education - he said it was 1 % of its TV output and 0.@@ 1 % on radio - and it should take a lead from public service broadcas@@ ters in Australia and Canada and change it to &quot; inform , en@@ ligh@@ ten and en@@ ter@@ tain . &quot;
on the issue of partnerships , El@@ ste@@ in said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said only a hand@@ ful were shown on TV , and enter into al@@ li@@ ances with commercial broadcas@@ ters to make them all available to watch online .
&apos;@@ S@@ on@@ o@@ gen@@ e@@ tics &apos; allows brain cel@@ ls to be controlled by sound waves

scientists have b@@ red wor@@ ms with gen@@ e@@ tically modi@@ fied ner@@ v@@ ous systems that can be controlled by bur@@ sts of sound waves .
the tiny ne@@ mato@@ des change direction the moment they are b@@ lasted with s@@ on@@ ic pul@@ ses that are too high @-@ p@@ it@@ ched for hum@@ ans to hear .
the pul@@ ses work by s@@ w@@ it@@ ching on m@@ ot@@ or ne@@ ur@@ on cel@@ ls that are gen@@ e@@ tically modi@@ fied to carry mem@@ br@@ an@@ e channels that respond to ul@@ tr@@ as@@ on@@ ic waves .
related : researchers read and write brain activity with light
researchers said the wor@@ ms demonstrate the power of a new procedure , dubbed s@@ on@@ o@@ gen@@ e@@ tics , in which ul@@ tr@@ as@@ ound can be used to activ@@ ate a range of brain , heart and m@@ us@@ c@@ le cel@@ ls from outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani , a researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in L@@ a J@@ ol@@ la , C@@ ali@@ for@@ n@@ ia , told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep @-@ brain sti@@ mu@@ lation , an inv@@ asi@@ ve procedure that deli@@ vers electrical pul@@ ses into people &apos;s bra@@ ins to treat symp@@ t@@ om@@ s of Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease .
Ne@@ mato@@ de wor@@ ms do not usually react to ul@@ tr@@ as@@ ound , but C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by a f@@ lu@@ id containing m@@ ic@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic bu@@ b@@ bles .
the bu@@ b@@ bles , he found , amp@@ lif@@ y the ul@@ tr@@ as@@ on@@ ic waves which then pass inside the wor@@ ms .
the amp@@ li@@ fied ul@@ tr@@ as@@ ound waves act on structures called T@@ R@@ P @-@ 4 Ion channels , found in the mem@@ br@@ an@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms &quot; cel@@ ls .
the sound waves make these Ion channels open up and activ@@ ate the cel@@ ls they are at@@ t@@ ac@@ hed to , according to a report in Nat@@ ure Communications .
to make ul@@ tr@@ as@@ ound @-@ controlled ne@@ mato@@ des , C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani gen@@ e@@ tically modi@@ fied the wor@@ ms so that some of their m@@ ot@@ or ne@@ ur@@ ons carried T@@ R@@ P @-@ 4 Ion channels .
when he applied ul@@ tr@@ as@@ ound to the modi@@ fied cre@@ at@@ ures , the sound waves were amp@@ li@@ fied by the m@@ ic@@ ro@@ bu@@ b@@ bles and trans@@ mit@@ ted into the wor@@ ms , where they s@@ w@@ it@@ ched on the modi@@ fied m@@ ot@@ or ne@@ ur@@ ons .
the procedure has some si@@ mil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ gen@@ e@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to s@@ w@@ it@@ ch ne@@ ur@@ ons on and off with pul@@ ses of light .
but C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani said that s@@ on@@ o@@ gen@@ e@@ tics could have some advantages over that te@@ ch@@ ni@@ que .
unlike light , which has to be sent down an op@@ tic fi@@ br@@ e to the desi@@ red location inside the brain , low f@@ re@@ qu@@ ency ul@@ tr@@ as@@ ound waves can pass through ti@@ s@@ sue un@@ hin@@ dered , and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the s@@ k@@ ul@@ l .
&quot; we believe that , using gen@@ e ther@@ ap@@ y and a ther@@ ap@@ e@@ u@@ tic virus , it may be possible to make target human ne@@ ur@@ ons temporarily s@@ us@@ cep@@ ti@@ ble to the ul@@ tr@@ as@@ ound signal in a cl@@ in@@ ical setting for certain ne@@ ur@@ ological tre@@ at@@ ments , &quot; said C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on m@@ us@@ c@@ le cel@@ ls and ins@@ ul@@ in @-@ producing cel@@ ls , he added .

eight golden rules for living in student hal@@ ls

moving into hal@@ ls can range from mil@@ dly ner@@ ve @-@ rac@@ king to totally ter@@ rif@@ ying .

that can be hel@@ l for someone who &apos;s trying to re@@ charge .
nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but I need you to go away so I can get back the energy I &apos;ve ex@@ pen@@ ded on inter@@ acting with you . &quot;

oil companies officially collapsed
an investment of 400 billion dollars was shel@@ ved and most deep @-@ sea oil exploration projects were suspended between 2014 , when oil prices started to drop , and the end of last year .
according to research from the consulting company W@@ o@@ od Mac@@ ken@@ z@@ ie , low oil prices were the cause of the suspension of the 3@@ 80 billion d@@ ol@@ lar @-@ project for oil and gas exploration / production , and the production of millions of bar@@ rels of oil was postponed in a vast area reaching from the M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an G@@ ul@@ f to Africa .
the report showing that the biggest reason for the price drop is that oil prices have fallen from their 2014 level of 1@@ 15 dollars to their lowest level in the last 12 years , losing more than 70 percent of their value in 1.5 years , includes the statement that &quot; company budgets have dramatically sh@@ run@@ k . &quot;
400 billion dollars O@@ N hold
while the c@@ ru@@ de oil price continues to surprise every single day , it has recently fallen under the 30 d@@ ol@@ lar mark , which is its lowest level in the last 12 years .
in these days of heated debates about &quot; whether the price of oil can fall below 15 dollars , &quot; or &quot; whether oil is dir@@ t cheap , &quot; the research published by the energy consulting firm W@@ o@@ od Mac@@ ken@@ z@@ ie reve@@ als how the sector has been affected by the falling prices .
suggesting that the falling oil prices caused the suspension of 46 big energy investments worth 200 billion dollars in a report published in July , W@@ o@@ od Mac@@ ken@@ z@@ ie , in new research , disclosed what the total figure was up to the end of 2015 .
according to this , while 22 more projects were postponed in the last six months of 2015 , a total of 68 projects were suspended from 2014 , when the drop in oil prices began .
the value of these projects is estimated at around 400 billion dollars .
2.@@ 9 million bar@@ rels P@@ E@@ R day
in the research , it has been underlined that the low oil prices had a &quot; brutal &quot; effect on company plans and it has been noted that the projects most affected were deep water development projects .
the suspended projects correspon@@ d to a total reserve of 27 billion bar@@ rels of c@@ ru@@ de oil , and the daily production of 2.@@ 9 million bar@@ rels has therefore been delayed until 20@@ 25 .
according to the research , the final investment decision for most of the af@@ o@@ re@@ mentioned projects was later shel@@ ved until 20@@ 17 , and the first production goals are targeting the years between 2020 and 20@@ 23 .
the report under@@ lines that the postponed 68 projects include a potential 1@@ 70 billion d@@ ol@@ lar investment that is predicted to be carried out in the next 5 years , and &quot; most of the 1@@ 70 billion dollars is comprised of deep water projects . &quot;
the reason for this is the high preliminary investment costs .
it is said that &quot; 70 percent of the deep @-@ sea ex@@ pen@@ di@@ ture is made up in particular of oil based projects in Ni@@ ger@@ ia , An@@ g@@ ola and the M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an G@@ ul@@ f in the U@@ .@@ S@@ . &quot;
according to the research , the countries having the biggest number of suspended projects are Canada , An@@ g@@ ola , K@@ az@@ ak@@ h@@ st@@ an , Ni@@ ger@@ ia , Norway and the U@@ .@@ S@@ .
these six countries have almost 90 percent of the suspended liqu@@ id ( oil ) reserves .
Mo@@ z@@ am@@ bi@@ que , Australia , Mal@@ ay@@ si@@ a and In@@ don@@ es@@ ia account for the biggest number of suspended gas reserves with 85 percent of the total .
most of the natural gas waiting to be extr@@ acted lies in deep waters , and requires complex and expensive solutions such as building a liqu@@ ef@@ ied natural gas ( L@@ N@@ G ) plant from scr@@ at@@ ch .
it has been stated that the most endangered companies are the oil gi@@ ants having suc@@ ces@@ sive under@@ t@@ ak@@ ings in the Canadian oil San@@ ds and the Caspian Sea Re@@ gi@@ on , and it is said that these companies are trying to adap@@ t to the scenario of &quot; lower for longer &quot; oil prices .
eyes O@@ N Iran
just four years ago the situation was as follows : the U@@ .@@ S@@ . and Europe imposed an embargo on Iran oil to stop Tehran &apos;s nuclear pro@@ gra@@ m ; the bar@@ rel price of oil was around 110 dollars and debate c@@ ent@@ red on how Iran &apos;s oil exports would be cut without causing any sharp jump in the prices .
when we return to this week , we witness a very different scenario .
oil prices have fallen below 30 dollars for the first time since 2004 , and the principal cause of this was the production boom in the U@@ .@@ S@@ . ; and embar@@ goes imposed on Iran being abolished .
for this reason , all the eyes are on Iran .
if Iran increases its oil exports , more oil will be added to the market , which is said to be already quite full .
this may cause the price to fall below even the surprising levels of today .
some analysts are saying that Saudi Ara@@ bia , not wan@@ ting to lose any market share to Iran , will p@@ ump more oil and Iran and S@@ . Ara@@ bia will enter a price war .
soon after the elimination of the en@@ for@@ c@@ ements , it is stated that the principal targets of Iran are India , being the fas@@ test growing oil market in Asia , and its old partners in Europe .
Iranian officials have previously said that they aimed to increase initial exports by 500 thousand bar@@ rels a day and to add the same amount to the market after a while .
according to the map data from Reuters , there are 22 very large c@@ ru@@ de carriers ( V@@ L@@ C@@ C ) waiting off the coast of Iran , 13 of which are fully or mostly lo@@ aded .
Iran is in the position of being the country with the fourth biggest proven oil reserves in the world .
thanks to ex@@ cep@@ tions within the embargo , Iran currently exports approximately 1 million bar@@ rels of c@@ ru@@ de oil to some countries including Turkey .
before the embargo , Iran &apos;s daily oil export increased to 3 million bar@@ rels a day .
a research speci@@ alist at sec@@ ur@@ ities company Des@@ te@@ k Men@@ k@@ ul D@@ e@@ Ä@@ er@@ ler , Ay@@ sun G@@ Ã¶@@ k@@ s@@ u , answers the question of whether oil will fall below 20 dollars as follows : &quot; China @-@ c@@ ent@@ red global growth concerns increase down@@ ward pressure on com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty prices and inten@@ si@@ fies the drop in oil prices . &quot;
we are seeing that losses reached 20 percent since the beginning of the year amid concerns that the demand for oil would decline in line with the economic slowdown in China , which is the biggest oil im@@ por@@ ter in the world .
in addition to this , we may witness oil prices below 30 dollars in the for@@ th@@ coming days due to the effects of the global appreciation of the d@@ ol@@ lar and the problem of global ex@@ cess supply .
as long as we do not see any permanent pri@@ cing above the 32 @-@ 33 d@@ ol@@ lar @-@ level , the up@@ ward movement of oil prices may remain limited and the down@@ ward pressure on prices may increase .
at that point , we can say that closing prices under the 30 d@@ ol@@ lar @-@ level will play a key role in the continuation of the decline .
in this situation , it should be no surprise if it is seen that there is a lo@@ os@@ ening of the support level of 2@@ 3.@@ 30 @-@ 2@@ 5.@@ 60 in the lower end .
Is@@ ham Sar@@ d@@ ou@@ k : &quot; the era of an@@ g@@ el@@ s is now over ! &quot;
while carrying out the duty of trend creation in W@@ G@@ S@@ N , which de@@ ter@@ min@@ es the fashion trends of Vic@@ tor@@ ia &apos;s Sec@@ ret and the world ; why did you change your course to Turkey ?
- I am always pro @-@ change .
I was born in Paris , lived in London , and after that went to New York .
I took up key positions there .
meanwhile , I started to provide consul@@ tan@@ cy services to K@@ ot@@ on over the last two years .
after that I saw the potential in this area and the brand K@@ ot@@ on .
I real@@ ized that everything needed to be a worldwide chain store was there .
now I &apos;m here to make it happen .
can you achieve this in a short time ?
- sure .
even though it is a small brand , it is already sold in 50 countries .
we launch 50 collec@@ tions every year , we have 15 different sections .
in other words , there is everything a chain store needs to have .
we can respond to the needs of the consumers in different areas from D@@ ub@@ a@@ i to Moscow .
currently , we are opening a store in Paris in May , and it is the beginning of a new and ex@@ citing era ...
is it a must to open a store in Paris ?
- Y@@ es .
it is not because the economic situation in Europe is great .
however , you open some stores for image .
you have stores in fashion capitals such as Paris , London and you make money in the Middle East .
one of them adds pres@@ ti@@ ge to the brand and the other adds money ; both of them are necessary for a brand making an effort to be global .
O@@ K , so let &apos;s talk about the trends ...
- We have a ro@@ man@@ tic and chi@@ c season ahead of us .
flying chi@@ ff@@ on d@@ res@@ ses , smooth ton@@ es , pin@@ ks , wh@@ ites , re@@ ds .
design@@ s ...
we are experiencing harsh and brutal times ; the fashion world always brings chi@@ c and heart @-@ war@@ ming design@@ s to the po@@ di@@ um and tries to add a tiny bit of h@@ ap@@ p@@ in@@ ess to life in times like this .
what we are doing is the same .
for this reason , the &quot; era of ele@@ g@@ ance &quot; is returning in the new season .
let &apos;s go back to your years in Vic@@ tor@@ ia &apos;s Sec@@ ret .
who was the most legendary an@@ gel ? - Kar@@ ol@@ ina Kur@@ kova .
I am not talking about her g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous physi@@ que : she is so positive and she is such a good girl !
while working , she sat bes@@ ide me and said &quot; Ar@@ e you hun@@ gr@@ y , hon@@ ey ? &quot; and gave me an app@@ le , et@@ c .
in a word , she was so swe@@ et .
you also know what I am talking about , I looked into you and discovered that you have done l@@ ots of inter@@ views with all the models of Vic@@ tor@@ ia &apos;s Sec@@ ret .
Kar@@ ol@@ ina is so beautiful , isn &apos;t she ?
but Ad@@ ri@@ ana L@@ im@@ a also impressed me with her beauty ...
- Y@@ ou have a point , but that voice !
her voice , her in@@ ton@@ ation ...
it stresses you after a while and you say , &quot; sit so@@ me@@ where and look beautiful ; do nothing else ! &quot;
it can ir@@ r@@ itate .
yes , you can experience these kinds of shocks .
I done an interview with Can@@ di@@ ce S@@ w@@ an@@ e@@ po@@ el .
she was the most beautiful girl I &apos;ve ever seen in my life but I was ast@@ on@@ ished by her empty @-@ he@@ ade@@ d@@ ness .
- M@@ ost of them are like that .
the new an@@ g@@ el@@ s are not like in the past ...
I remember the time of G@@ is@@ el@@ e ...
it was quite hard to work with her though .
she used to come back@@ stage and smoke like a ch@@ im@@ ne@@ y .
it was not because she is addi@@ c@@ ted .
nobody can smoke you see , only she can smoke !
it is just to be a &quot; di@@ va . &quot;
broadcast two months ago , the Vic@@ tor@@ ia &apos;s Sec@@ ret fashion par@@ ade got the lowest rating in its history .
why do you think that is ?
- A@@ s I said , that legendary era of beautiful an@@ g@@ el@@ s is now over .
par@@ don me , who needs G@@ ig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d ?
what is beautiful about her ?
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner , for example , she is as flat as a board ...
there are no cur@@ ves , there is nothing .
K@@ ate m@@ os@@ s is not cur@@ v@@ y either but she became the biggest name in the fashion industry .
- It is true but her face was so beautiful .
I want to use my right to ob@@ j@@ ect .
last year , I did an interview with her ; her face has g@@ ot@@ ten quite old ...
- Bet@@ we@@ en smoking and alcohol , she n@@ atur@@ ally lost her beauty .
but she had such a beautiful face in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
her li@@ ps were like Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Bar@@ do@@ t &apos;s .
she represents the end of the super@@ model era .
the era of Linda E@@ van@@ g@@ el@@ ist@@ a , N@@ a@@ om@@ i C@@ amp@@ bel@@ l and Christ@@ y Tur@@ l@@ ing@@ ton ...
Christ@@ y was my next door @-@ neighbour and I saw her without mak@@ e@@ up .
there cannot be such p@@ ure beauty , there cannot be such ele@@ g@@ ance .
what about C@@ ara Dele@@ v@@ ing@@ ne ?
- S@@ he &apos;s was@@ ting her@@ self .
there is no need to be involved in every campaign .
people get bo@@ red .
besides , there is no hunger for &quot; famous models and c@@ ele@@ bri@@ ties &quot; like in the past .
people want to see real faces like their own faces in the campaigns .
we will go towards this .
because the trend is this .
a letter to Turkey from 25 authors
according to reports from BBC Turkish , writers from the Wor@@ l@@ d@@ wide Association of W@@ rit@@ ers ( P@@ E@@ N ) , including its presidents in England , W@@ al@@ es and S@@ c@@ ot@@ land , stated that threats and physical attacks against their colleagues , writers and p@@ ub@@ lis@@ h@@ ers in Turkey have become a normal part of life .
in the letter , the investigations and detention of journalists in Turkey were regarded as wor@@ r@@ ying developments as well as the two attacks on the Hurriyet daily newspaper , the raid on the K@@ oz@@ a Group and detention of Vice News correspon@@ dents .
part @-@ time work rights for mo@@ thers causes debate
T@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ k @-@ Ä°@@ Å says &quot; We think that part @-@ time rights have been given to mo@@ thers to bring in labour for h@@ ire . &quot;
&quot; it may be a Tro@@ jan hor@@ se , &quot; and T@@ Ä°@@ S@@ K claimed &quot; We are worried about whether this regulation on behalf of women will prevent women from work or not . &quot;
new rights planned for civil servants and working women after giving birth or adoption were passed by the committee after day long negotiations .
&quot; labour for h@@ ire &quot; became the main topic in the committee negotiations of the regulations , which will bring the right of part @-@ time work or unpaid leave to 6 months after giving birth and part @-@ time work up until primary school age for the child .
while st@@ at@@ ing that it is proper to recru@@ it on a part @-@ time basis until the child starts primary school they still have worries , a CHP deputy of Izmir M@@ us@@ a Ã@@ am added , &quot; I@@ f you bring the labour for h@@ ire regulation , we will stand against it to the bitter end . &quot;
taking part in the ne@@ go@@ tions on behalf of T@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ k @-@ Ä°@@ Å and saying they have the same worries , En@@ is B@@ a@@ Ä@@ da@@ di@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u stated , &quot; We have doubts about how the places for part @-@ time working women will be filled . &quot;
adding that if labour for h@@ ire is added to the agenda again on this occasion there will be matters much more pro@@ ble@@ matic than su@@ b @-@ contracted labour , B@@ a@@ Ä@@ da@@ di@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u said , &quot; We will watch the developments related to private employment agencies with much concern . &quot;
the general secretary of T@@ Ä°@@ S@@ K , B@@ Ã¼@@ l@@ ent P@@ ir@@ ler stated that part @-@ time work for a period of 5 years came about with this law , and he added , &quot; Th@@ ere is no part @-@ time work for such a long period in other countries . &quot;
also look at the matter this way .
&quot; it is necessary to think about the consequences of this implementation in places having 1 or 2 employees . &quot;
T@@ O@@ B@@ B advis@@ or Ahmet Å@@ a@@ Ä@@ ar also said that there will be problems finding workers if the regulation is implemented .
adding that there is no legislation related to the rules to be implemented on part @-@ time work , Å@@ a@@ Ä@@ ar stated , &quot; Em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ers and employees should come to an agreement until regulations related to private employment agencies have been made . &quot;
M@@ e@@ tin F@@ ey@@ zi@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u : we don &apos;t support it
the statement from F@@ ey@@ zi@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u is as follows : &quot; we don &apos;t stand by this declaration ; it is not possible for us to stand by and support it . &quot;
because there isn &apos;t one sentence of criticism against the PKK .
you couldn &apos;t say anything un@@ favourable , even one sentence against this separatist terror organiz@@ ation , the PKK ; they are considered above blame .
they are only harsh ex@@ pres@@ sions to the state ; we don &apos;t take those who used them seriously or find them s@@ inc@@ ere .
we are legal experts , we are lawyers .
if there is any illegal behaviour from representatives of the state , public officials and security forces in this context , let us go after it .
when we say &quot; don &apos;t demol@@ ish the state &quot; to the separ@@ ati@@ sts or the re@@ lic@@ s of the period of tru@@ ce who symp@@ ath@@ ise and ro@@ man@@ tic@@ ise the separ@@ ati@@ sts , they attack by calling us &quot; separatist , fas@@ c@@ ist . &quot;
when we say , &quot; this state should be@@ have in accordance with the law and should always value the law most , &quot; they say , &quot; you are acting as a separatist &quot; to us .
we are a bridge .
we are the people who are obliged to always tell the truth .

who is Ber@@ g@@ en ?
Ber@@ g@@ en , whose real name is Bel@@ gin Sar@@ Ä±@@ l@@ m@@ Ä±@@ Å@@ er , was born in Mer@@ s@@ in on July 16 , 19@@ 60 .
when her parents di@@ v@@ or@@ ced in 19@@ 66 , she settled in Ankara with her mother S@@ eb@@ ah@@ at Ã@@ ak@@ Ä±@@ r .
after attending Y@@ en@@ ima@@ hal@@ le Y@@ un@@ us Em@@ re Pri@@ m@@ ary School , she entered the Pi@@ ano Department of Ankara State Con@@ ser@@ v@@ atory , but left because of financial difficulties and worked at the post office for a while by lying about her age .
she accepted an offer of work after she took to the stage in the F@@ ey@@ man N@@ ight Club where she went for a night out with friends in 197@@ 9 .
in the F@@ ey@@ man N@@ ight Club , she performed Turkish Art Music , Turkish L@@ ight Music and popular arrangements of that time with Gru@@ p L@@ ok@@ omo@@ ti@@ f .
moving to Ad@@ ana from Ankara for work , Ber@@ g@@ en met Hal@@ is Ser@@ b@@ es there and married him the following year .
she released her L@@ P &quot; I H@@ ave an a@@ x@@ e to gr@@ in@@ d &quot; with the record company At@@ las P@@ la@@ k in 19@@ 8@@ 2 .
while she was making her breakthrough in her artistic life , Ber@@ g@@ en had to cope with a violent husband and she es@@ cap@@ ed from him many times .
in October 19@@ 8@@ 2 while working in Ä°@@ z@@ mir , ac@@ id was thrown in her face under the orders of her husband .
having lost an eye and suffering bur@@ ns to much of her body , Ber@@ g@@ an was per@@ su@@ aded to return to the stage by Cen@@ gi@@ z Ã@@ z@@ Å@@ ek@@ er after her treatment , who is the composer of the song &quot; Wh@@ o knows ? &quot; p@@ op@@ ul@@ ar@@ ised by K@@ i@@ bar@@ i@@ y@@ e .
having performed in the Ä°@@ z@@ mir P@@ Ä±@@ r@@ lan@@ ta N@@ ight Club , owned by Ã@@ z@@ Å@@ ek@@ er , until 19@@ 8@@ 5 , the artist prepared a de@@ m@@ o tape called &quot; S@@ is@@ ter of D@@ est@@ in@@ y &quot; with her bos@@ s and sent it to Y@@ a@@ Å@@ ar K@@ ek@@ eva .

re@@ le@@ as@@ ing her first professional L@@ P &quot; I@@ f a Per@@ son F@@ al@@ ls in L@@ o@@ ve &quot; onto the Istanbul music market under the musical management of Bur@@ han B@@ ay@@ ar , the artist became famous with &quot; The W@@ om@@ an of S@@ or@@ row , &quot; which she produced at the end of 19@@ 8@@ 6 .
her al@@ bu@@ m was successful and in April 19@@ 8@@ 7 she was awarded the Golden Rec@@ or@@ d and Golden T@@ ap@@ e pri@@ z@@ es with the title &quot; The Best selling Ara@@ bes@@ que F@@ em@@ ale Ar@@ tist in 19@@ 8@@ 6 &quot; by her rec@@ or@@ ding company .

they will be de@@ por@@ ted with bi@@ cy@@ c@@ les
however , the refugees , most of whom are Sy@@ ri@@ ans , will have to return to Russia by p@@ ed@@ alling in min@@ us 20 degrees because the two countries could not reach an agreement .
a group of refugees went to Russia by plane , travelled to the north of the country and went to Norway from Mur@@ man@@ s@@ k because it is sa@@ f@@ er and cheaper during the summer months .
as the agreement between the two countries does not allow crossing of the border on fo@@ ot , the refugees cr@@ os@@ sed the border by bi@@ cycle .
Norway has now decided to return these refugees .
for this reason , the Norway Police ordered the repair of the bi@@ cy@@ c@@ les that were abandoned after crossing the border .
&quot; 3 billion euros to Turkey &quot; crisis in EU
the crisis is continuing with 3 billion euros pledged to Turkey for the refugees .
the President of the European Commission , Jean C@@ lau@@ de J@@ unc@@ ker , criticised the Prime Minister of Italy , Mat@@ te@@ o R@@ en@@ zi &apos;s blocking of the funds to be transferred to Turkey .
st@@ at@@ ing that the mood between Italy and the rest of Europe is not good , J@@ unc@@ ker underlined that the EU has to find the 3 billion euros .
J@@ unc@@ ker said &quot; T@@ his money is not for Turkey , but for Syrian refugees in Turkey . &quot;
we have not yet reached 3 billion .
&quot; this is an issue related to the credibility of the EU and is therefore very important , &quot; he said .
J@@ unc@@ ker stated that he expected the money to be completed by January 26 , which was the deadline given .
Italy is one of the countries drawing attention for their positive attitudes when it comes to Turkey .
diplomatic sources say that Rome &apos;s stance is related to the financial package and not towards Turkey , and is related to the problems between Italy , the European Commission and some member countries of the union .
there has been tension between Italy and the EU for a while now .
R@@ en@@ zi continued to har@@ sh@@ ly cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ ze the Chancellor of Germany , Angela Merkel , and the EU in the latest EU summit on energy , banking and immigration .
cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ ing the attitude of R@@ en@@ zi in y@@ es@@ ter@@ day &apos;s press conference , J@@ unc@@ ker said that &quot; R@@ en@@ zi should quit accusing the EU . &quot;
&quot; it is wrong of R@@ en@@ zi , even though I like him very much , to hum@@ ili@@ ate the European Commission on every occasion . &quot;
J@@ unc@@ ker imp@@ lied that R@@ en@@ zi plays to internal public opinion .
1 billion of the 3 billion euros , promised to Turkey , will be covered by the EU budget .
2 billion euros will be covered by the budgets of the member countries .
Germany will contribute at le@@ st 4@@ 27 million euros .
it has been decided that 2.@@ 3 billion euros will be transferred to the EU budget and used to support Jordan and Lebanon by the Greek Cypriot Administration , which declared that it won &apos;t transfer money to Turkey for political reasons .
the funds are predicted to be used during the 20@@ 16 @-@ 20@@ 17 period .
I cri@@ ed when I saw the Char@@ lie H@@ eb@@ do car@@ toon
speaking to the Russian official news agency Sp@@ ut@@ nik , the father Abdullah Kur@@ di reacted strongly and said , &quot; to tell the truth , I cri@@ ed because of that car@@ toon . &quot;
&quot; I felt very bad . &quot;
st@@ at@@ ing that he expected positive things from the French s@@ ati@@ ri@@ cal magazine Char@@ lie H@@ eb@@ do , which has become the symbol of freedom of expression after the armed attack , Kur@@ di added the following :
they made a bad car@@ toon unfortunately .
everybody felt very sa@@ d about this car@@ toon .
Ay@@ lan is a 2 year old boy and he died .
Char@@ lie H@@ eb@@ do was supposed to show respect to Ay@@ lan , to me and my family , but the exact op@@ pos@@ ite is true .
this magazine should show respect to the dead children .
they published a dis@@ res@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ ful car@@ toon about our hon@@ our@@ able Pro@@ p@@ he@@ t .
they even made public@@ ations regarding Al@@ la@@ h .
compared with the public@@ ations on Al@@ la@@ h and our Pro@@ p@@ he@@ t , what they done to my son is a small thing .
Kur@@ di , living in Er@@ bi@@ l , made the following appeal : &quot; I call on the whole world and the s@@ ati@@ ri@@ cal ma@@ g@@ az@@ ines to show respect to all the dead children . &quot;
they should not add to the gri@@ ef the families are already suffering .
T@@ im@@ a Kur@@ di , an a@@ un@@ t of Ay@@ lan Kur@@ di living in Canada , is also among those to react to the car@@ toon .
in the car@@ toon by La@@ ur@@ ent &quot; R@@ is@@ s &quot; S@@ our@@ is@@ se@@ a@@ u , it is imp@@ lied that 3 year old Syrian Ay@@ lan Kur@@ di , whose dead body came ash@@ ore at B@@ od@@ ru@@ m , &quot; may have become one of the sex ab@@ users in Germany when he gro@@ ws up . &quot;
last year , having been exposed to an attack in which religious ra@@ dic@@ als killed 12 people because of the publication of car@@ to@@ ons depic@@ ting Mu@@ ham@@ ma@@ d , French s@@ ati@@ ri@@ cal magazine Char@@ lie H@@ eb@@ do become the focus of discussions with its car@@ toon of Ay@@ lan Kur@@ di .
in the car@@ toon the mo@@ le@@ sters , with pi@@ g heads , ev@@ oking immigrants and also ch@@ as@@ ing women , who were por@@ tr@@ ay@@ ed like the women ab@@ used during the new year celebrations in Germany , especially C@@ olo@@ gn@@ e .
having s@@ tir@@ red up different reactions on social media , the car@@ toon is part of a col@@ um@@ n consisting of 4 fra@@ mes .
&quot; this is not France &quot; is written on the col@@ um@@ n , and the lost values of France and increasing hos@@ ti@@ li@@ ty against refugees are cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed according to many readers .
on the other hand , the car@@ toon caused many people to ac@@ c@@ use Char@@ lie H@@ eb@@ do of rac@@ ism .
while Char@@ lie H@@ eb@@ do praised Germany , which accepted 800 thousand refugees , it cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed France for its un@@ willing attitude towards opening its doors to refugees in an issue published last year .
it was said in the car@@ toon &quot; the goal was too close &quot; and &quot; two children &apos;s men@@ us for the price of one &quot; was written in the advertising pos@@ ter .
&quot; Aut@@ op@@ si@@ es in Germany for the Ger@@ man@@ s who died in S@@ ul@@ tan@@ ah@@ met &quot;
according to information on the website of the weekly magazine D@@ er Sp@@ i@@ e@@ gel , the German Federal Prosecutor &apos;s Office decided that the bodies of the 10 people who died in the attack , will be brought to Germany .
the bodies of the dead will be brought home today or tomorrow on a German Air Forces plane and will be welcomed by a ceremony at the airport .
experts from the I@@ denti@@ fication Commission of the Federal Criminal Police Office ( B@@ K@@ A ) , who carry out for@@ en@@ sic operations in Germany , n@@ or@@ m@@ ally travel to the countries where an incident has occurred to conduct the identification and aut@@ op@@ sy for German citizens killed in accidents or attacks .
however , the magazine D@@ er Sp@@ i@@ e@@ gel wrote that things will be done differ@@ ently this time .
according to the magazine , officials from the Federal Criminal Police Office applied to Turkish authorities to conduct the identification and aut@@ op@@ sy operations in Istanbul but the request was refused .
the Federal Criminal Police Office sent four experts to Istanbul after the Istanbul attack .
treatment is continuing on seven German tourists who were injured in the attack .

ban@@ ning of male refugees from swimming po@@ ols
in a report in the German press , it was reported that the ban will be lifted if the vol@@ un@@ te@@ er workers from the dor@@ mit@@ or@@ ies noti@@ fy them that the message has been understood by the refugees .
st@@ at@@ ing in his interview to W@@ D@@ R that the municipality does not want to punish innocent people because of the behaviour of a few people , an official from the social affairs department , Mar@@ k@@ us Sch@@ n@@ ap@@ ka , said that those staying in the dor@@ mit@@ or@@ ies had been informed in three languages about the important values in Germany .
noting that they will not discuss the value of gender equality important to Germany , Sch@@ n@@ ap@@ ka added that the municipality will punish all kinds of attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
meanwhile , R@@ he@@ in@@ berg has cancelled its annual car@@ ni@@ val because of the possibility of C@@ olo@@ gn@@ e @-@ style attacks oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ing during the celebrations .
the municipality declared that the festival par@@ ade was cancelled because there is no guarantee that incidents of har@@ ass@@ ment would not occur .
what are the benefits of ste@@ am co@@ oking ?
a te@@ ch@@ ni@@ que that does not kill v@@ it@@ am@@ ins and min@@ er@@ als in food , ste@@ am co@@ oking is becoming increasingly popular .
ste@@ am co@@ oking , one of the most pre@@ fer@@ red co@@ oking methods in the F@@ ar @-@ East for centuries , st@@ ren@@ g@@ th@@ ens the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ism and makes di@@ ges@@ tion easier .
bac@@ ter@@ ia and ger@@ ms in food are completely er@@ adi@@ ca@@ ted with this method , which also eli@@ min@@ ates problems such as dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ si@@ a .
substan@@ ces found in fo@@ ods such as pro@@ te@@ in , cel@@ l@@ ul@@ ose and star@@ ch completely dis@@ ol@@ ve using this te@@ ch@@ ni@@ que , making the food so@@ f@@ ter .
taking place in low pressure , ste@@ am co@@ oking is done in a co@@ oking po@@ t with the help of ste@@ am pot@@ s or ste@@ am ma@@ ch@@ ines .
both the amount of water used and the co@@ oking time is less when co@@ oking at high pressure .
the best example of this is co@@ oking in a pressure co@@ ok@@ er .
especially for co@@ oking di@@ et@@ ary fo@@ ods such as ve@@ g@@ et@@ ab@@ les , it is necessary to was@@ h the ve@@ g@@ et@@ ab@@ les well first , and then it is necessary to put them into a stra@@ in@@ er and wait for the water to strain .
one @-@ third of a deep co@@ oking po@@ t is filled with water and a ste@@ am stra@@ in@@ er is placed inside the po@@ t .
the m@@ ou@@ th of the co@@ oking po@@ t is half closed .
in this way , we allow ste@@ am to escape from the co@@ oking po@@ t .
f@@ ir@@ st@@ ly the heat of the ov@@ en is set to the highest degree and the water is bo@@ iled ; after the tem@@ per@@ ature is fixed by setting the heat in the ov@@ en to a lower degree .
the ve@@ g@@ et@@ ab@@ les and food are ste@@ am co@@ oked for 10 @-@ 15 minutes and are then ch@@ ec@@ ked with the help of a for@@ k once they are co@@ oked .
the co@@ oked ve@@ g@@ et@@ ab@@ les are removed from the ov@@ en and served on plates .
appearance , col@@ our and ar@@ om@@ a of the food do not change with the ste@@ am co@@ oking te@@ ch@@ ni@@ que ; therefore this is a healthy method .
the distinc@@ tive tas@@ te of the food stays the same .
therefore the quality and f@@ la@@ v@@ our of the food are not sp@@ o@@ iled .
loss of n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion is kept to a minimum in ste@@ am co@@ oking , which is also the most ec@@ on@@ om@@ ical way of co@@ oking .
Ste@@ amed ve@@ g@@ et@@ ab@@ les offer a satisfactory f@@ la@@ v@@ our for the din@@ er with their fresh and vi@@ br@@ ant appearance .
frequently used , especially as part of a di@@ et , this method is often pre@@ fer@@ red also because it is very light .
David Bo@@ wi@@ e - Bla@@ ck@@ star : the ali@@ en &apos;s &quot; last al@@ bu@@ m &quot;
kno@@ wing that you will die ; producing that final al@@ bu@@ m without telling anyone ; making your de@@ ath@@ bed an artistic expression in the music video you shot ...
these kinds of actions may seem &quot; extreme &quot; to us m@@ or@@ t@@ al ear@@ th@@ l@@ ings .
I say m@@ or@@ t@@ al ear@@ th@@ l@@ ings because I am among those who believe that the man who did this is both Im@@ m@@ or@@ t@@ al and ali@@ en .
he came to our world from some cor@@ ner of the uni@@ verse ; now he has returned to his mo@@ ther@@ land ; which is just how it goes .
he came because it was necessary to in@@ sp@@ ire not only K@@ is@@ s , Mar@@ il@@ y@@ n M@@ ans@@ on or L@@ ad@@ y G@@ ag@@ a , but also all the s@@ in@@ gers of the world .
he fulfilled his duty with success .
David Bo@@ wi@@ e , Bla@@ ck@@ star , i@@ Tun@@ es price : 9.@@ 99 T@@ L 5 / 5
maybe he was no@@ ur@@ ished by W@@ ar@@ ho@@ l and K@@ ub@@ ri@@ ck from the same plan@@ et as him .
when A@@ pol@@ lo 11 lan@@ ded on ear@@ th , he decided to say &quot; this is nothing , I am an ali@@ en , &quot; and he joined us by sing@@ ing &quot; Sp@@ ace O@@ d@@ di@@ ty . &quot;
actually he did not join us ; he was always ahead of us .
thanks to him , many people found their way .
both musicians and l@@ ist@@ en@@ ers ...
if we leave aside his interest in plastic arts , his acting et@@ c . , it would be wrong to say that his music was &quot; just music . &quot;
the char@@ ac@@ ters he created by himself , travelling from song to song , his refer@@ ences , innovation , tab@@ o@@ o @-@ breaking behaviour and dis@@ co@@ graphy reflect an artistic integrity for me .
I can remember him neither as the father of g@@ la@@ m rock , nor as the co@@ us@@ in of pun@@ k ...
if I remember him like that , what will happen to his av@@ ant @-@ gar@@ de and electronic works , and to jazz , which he kept as an internal love since his ch@@ ild@@ hood ?
David Bo@@ wi@@ e always reminded us what the expression &quot; ic@@ on &quot; means , up until that time when the word spread like w@@ ild@@ fire .
he was not a man ; he was not a woman ; he was not &quot; human . &quot;
he was a body .
it seemed to us that he was on a mission .
that body left this world two days after the release of his 26th stu@@ dio al@@ bu@@ m &quot; Bla@@ ck@@ star . &quot;
he tried to prepare us for the fact that he would leave with &quot; Bla@@ ck@@ star &quot; and &quot; L@@ az@@ ar@@ us , &quot; which we had l@@ ist@@ en@@ ed to before the release of the al@@ bu@@ m .
we thought that &quot; he has g@@ ot@@ ten old now , so he talks about death , &quot; but he was aware of everything .
one more final hand ...
we can say that there are four songs that we already knew when the al@@ bu@@ m was released ; &quot; Bla@@ ck@@ star &quot; and &quot; L@@ az@@ ar@@ us , &quot; sho@@ ul@@ dering the burden of message and emo@@ tion , &quot; S@@ ue ( O@@ r In A Se@@ as@@ on O@@ f Crime ) &quot; and &quot; T@@ is A p@@ ity S@@ he W@@ as A Wh@@ ore , &quot; previously released but re @-@ recorded for this al@@ bu@@ m .
I would add that the remaining songs , &quot; G@@ ir@@ l Lov@@ es M@@ e , &quot; &quot; I C@@ an &apos;t Gi@@ ve E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing A@@ way &quot; and &quot; D@@ ol@@ lar Days , &quot; are also very good .
when we look at &quot; Bla@@ ck@@ star &quot; as a whole , it was created on a very strong musical structure , but it feels like it was produced with s@@ inc@@ ere and in@@ stan@@ tan@@ e@@ ous fe@@ el@@ ings as well .
it is an al@@ bu@@ m neither of death nor a &quot; rec@@ k@@ on@@ ing with the past ... &quot;
it is just a real &quot; final &quot; al@@ bu@@ m .
&quot; the En@@ d &quot; cap@@ tion of a life in music , which is a mas@@ ter@@ piece in its enti@@ re@@ ty .
Turkey was targeted in the S@@ ul@@ tan@@ ah@@ met attack
on German TV channel A@@ R@@ D , Hol@@ ger M@@ Ã¼@@ n@@ ch , head of the German Federal Criminal Police Office , gave details of the incident which occurred on Tuesday in S@@ ul@@ tan@@ ah@@ met Square and in which 10 German citizens lost their lives .
M@@ Ã¼@@ n@@ ch stated that the target of the attack was not German citizens , but Turkey .
&quot; 400 people under surveillance &quot;
however , M@@ Ã¼@@ n@@ ch indicated that the S@@ ul@@ tan@@ ah@@ met attack did not al@@ ter the danger of terror attacks in Germany and added , &quot; we are still under a threat that must be taken seriously . &quot;
indi@@ c@@ ating that there was a decrease in the number of those travelling to Syria to join Is@@ is , M@@ Ã¼@@ n@@ ch pointed out that many people have returned from the war zone .
saying that this is a big challenge to security forces , M@@ Ã¼@@ n@@ ch added &quot; No@@ w , there are approximately 400 people that we must keep under surveillance . &quot;
M@@ Ã¼@@ n@@ ch requested that co@@ ordination between police de@@ par@@ t@@ ments in Europe be enhanced and that there be closer communication .
Turkish authorities say that the suicide b@@ om@@ ber who organiz@@ ed the S@@ ul@@ tan@@ ah@@ met attack was a citizen of Syria and a member of Is@@ is ; T@@ ho@@ mas de Ma@@ iz@@ i@@ ere , the German Minister of Internal Affairs , stated that the at@@ t@@ ack@@ er could not yet be identified .
Se@@ z@@ en Ak@@ s@@ u says go@@ od@@ b@@ y@@ e to the stage
top@@ ping off her 4@@ 0th year with a series of concerts , Se@@ z@@ en Ak@@ s@@ u wo@@ wed fans with the concert &quot; Y@@ e@@ ars with Se@@ z@@ en &quot; y@@ es@@ ter@@ day evening at the V@@ ol@@ k@@ sw@@ ag@@ en Ar@@ ena .
the first part of the concert series was organiz@@ ed in July , while the second part was performed at the V@@ ol@@ k@@ sw@@ ag@@ en Ar@@ ena on January 15 and 16 .
during the concert , Ak@@ s@@ u brought the audience on a 40 @-@ year journey from the past to the present .
in addition to the love songs that touched our personal lives , Ak@@ s@@ u performed songs about social issues related to our country and the wider world .
Ak@@ s@@ u sa@@ d@@ den@@ ed her fans when she declared that she would bid f@@ ar@@ e@@ well to stage life after performing all the concerts .
in the concert &quot; Y@@ e@@ ars with Se@@ z@@ en , &quot; Se@@ z@@ en Ak@@ s@@ u appeared with a separate story for every song in front of the fans that had crowded into the V@@ ol@@ k@@ sw@@ ag@@ en Ar@@ ena .
all the stories , performances , li@@ ghts and stage shows accompanied the audience through very different er@@ as .
in the latter part of this un@@ for@@ g@@ et@@ table concert , a video presentation was also made showing the Istanbul paintings of D@@ ev@@ ri@@ m Er@@ bi@@ l .
moreover , Ak@@ s@@ u also showed vide@@ os recorded by her fans for the first time , therefore allowing them to share the stage with her .
a price increase of 25 k@@ ur@@ u@@ Å on bread in Ankara and Istanbul
with an increase of 25 k@@ ur@@ u@@ Å , 2@@ 50@@ g of bread began to be sold for 1 T@@ L as of y@@ es@@ ter@@ day in Ankara .
upon speculation that &quot; the price of bread would increase &quot; before the new year , especially in December , F@@ ar@@ uk Ã@@ e@@ li@@ k , minister of food , agriculture and li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and B@@ Ã¼@@ l@@ ent T@@ Ã¼@@ f@@ ek@@ Ã§@@ i , minister of customs and trade stated that &quot; there would be no price increase . &quot;
however , 2@@ 50@@ g of bread was selling for 1 T@@ L y@@ es@@ ter@@ day in the capital , Ankara .
the head of the Turkish Bak@@ ers &apos; Federation , Hal@@ il Ä°@@ bra@@ him Bal@@ c@@ Ä± stated that , regarding the 25 k@@ ur@@ u@@ Å price increase on bread , &quot; No price increase was imposed , the price list of 2 years ago began to be applied &quot; and added :
&quot; it was a price decision taken 2 years ago . &quot;
the Chamber of mer@@ chan@@ ts &apos; union decided on this price 2 years ago .
it is a price implemented throughout Turkey .
in other words , there was no application and implementation of a price increase .
however some bak@@ eries sold bread for 75 k@@ ur@@ u@@ Å in some regions of Ankara due to competition .
in other regions , it was already being sold for 1 T@@ L .
bak@@ ers , confident about the quality of their bread , did not decrease their prices . they have to implement 1 T@@ L due to competition .
there is no price increase .
they are implementing the price that had not been implemented before .
&quot; the price of bread per kil@@ o certainly won &apos;t exceed 5 T@@ L in the first half of 20@@ 16 , and we will end this year with this price if we do not experience any major problems . &quot;
in some areas of Istanbul , bread started to be sold for 1.@@ 25 T@@ L .
blo@@ od@@ y terror attack this time in Bur@@ k@@ ina F@@ as@@ o
23 people from 18 different countries were killed in the attack which targeted a luxury hotel known to be pre@@ fer@@ red by foreigners and officials from the United N@@ ations in the West African country Bur@@ k@@ ina F@@ as@@ o .
al Qaeda &apos;s North Africa branch claimed responsibility for the attack .
the attack in Bur@@ k@@ ina F@@ as@@ o occurred four days after the terrorist attack by Is@@ is on Jak@@ ar@@ ta , the capital of In@@ don@@ es@@ ia , which is the most crowded Muslim country in the world with a population of 250 million .
one Canadian and one In@@ don@@ es@@ ian were killed in the gun and bomb attacks that were carried out during the day@@ time at a branch of Star@@ bu@@ cks and a police box on a busy street containing foreign embassies , lu@@ x@@ ur@@ ious hotels and shops .
In@@ don@@ es@@ ian officials explained that the at@@ t@@ ack@@ ers were inspired by the Paris massacre on November 13 .
a security correspondent from English television channel the BBC , Frank gar@@ ner , pointed out that this attack was a part of a fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing ten@@ den@@ cy man@@ i@@ f@@ es@@ ting itself recently in different cities around the world .
the U@@ .@@ S@@ . was also hurt by terrorist actions a short time ago .
14 people were killed in an armed attack carried out by a couple symp@@ a@@ the@@ tic to I@@ si@@ l in S@@ an Ber@@ n@@ ad@@ in@@ o , C@@ ali@@ for@@ n@@ ia in the U@@ .@@ S@@ . at the beginning of last December .
the &quot; S@@ an Ber@@ n@@ ard@@ ino &quot; attack hor@@ ri@@ fies the U@@ .@@ S@@ .
after the suicide bombing attack on S@@ ul@@ tan@@ ah@@ met that killed 10 German tourists , T@@ ho@@ mas de Ma@@ iz@@ i@@ ere , the German Minister of Internal Affairs , reminded us that there are many terrorist attacks oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ing in many places around the world , and added , &quot; We have experienced two big attacks in Paris . &quot;
if we say this , then terror will win ...
we used the expression &quot; standing firm . &quot;
I@@ si@@ l have stopped using W@@ hat@@ s@@ ap@@ p , and now use the Al@@ ra@@ w@@ i application
according to a new report , the terrorist organiz@@ ation I@@ si@@ l is benef@@ iting from its own ch@@ at tool for commun@@ ic@@ ating without having to depend on applications such as W@@ hat@@ s@@ ap@@ p and tele@@ gra@@ m .
according to the report from D@@ ef@@ en@@ se O@@ ne , the organiz@@ ation is benef@@ iting from a new mes@@ sa@@ ging application for mes@@ sa@@ ging inside the organiz@@ ation .
named &quot; Al@@ ra@@ w@@ i , &quot; this An@@ dro@@ id application is distributed and installed via an A@@ P@@ K file .
the application allows the organiz@@ ation to cip@@ her messages and share media among themselves .
a surprising move from I@@ si@@ l in Iraq
according to gh@@ ost Security Group , func@@ tionality of the application is &quot; pri@@ m@@ iti@@ ve &quot; in comparison with such popular applications as W@@ hat@@ s@@ ap@@ p and tele@@ gra@@ m .
for now , it is not known how strong the ci@@ ph@@ ering used is .
before this , I@@ si@@ l carried out all of its communication via tele@@ gra@@ m , an application allowing messages to be sent on en@@ cr@@ y@@ p@@ ted connections .
however , tele@@ gra@@ m revealed all the channels in which the I@@ si@@ l members were ch@@ at@@ ting .
in addition to this , the U@@ .@@ S@@ . government has requested that application develop@@ ers put back @-@ doors in their applications .
for this reason , the organiz@@ ation has now started to use its own solutions rather than re@@ lying on the ci@@ ph@@ ering of W@@ hat@@ s@@ ap@@ p and tele@@ gra@@ m .

mid @-@ term break is an important opportunity to get ready for the new school term and to review last term .
being free time , the mid @-@ term break is also a good opportunity for person@@ ality development , acquisition of knowledge and skills , and taking up a new ho@@ b@@ by .
make a list of what to do during the term .
write down everything you plan to do , and try to put it into practice .
you can be sure that you will benefit from this and have a more efficient term .
now , f@@ ir@@ st@@ ly , let &apos;s talk about how efficient the term should be for students preparing for the Y@@ G@@ S @-@ L@@ Y@@ S ex@@ ams .
because the most common questions coming from the students preparing for Y@@ G@@ S @-@ L@@ Y@@ S are as follows : &quot; how should we use this time , should we solve a lot of questions or finish in@@ complete subjects ? &quot;
f@@ ir@@ st@@ ly , le@@ ts introduce our article with both the answers to these questions and some advice to those who are preparing for the ex@@ am in order to spend the time e@@ ff@@ ic@@ i@@ ently .
while the preparation period for the ex@@ ams should be a process that starts from the 9th grade , under normal conditions , we are trying instead to complete it in the final 1 year ; this ob@@ li@@ ges us to spend our last year more effectively , by using our time more e@@ ff@@ ic@@ i@@ ently and properly .
a final grade student must deal with both the ex@@ am preparation and preparation for school written ex@@ ams at the same time .
even if the graduate students have finished school and experienced the ex@@ am ( Y@@ G@@ S @-@ L@@ Y@@ S ) at least once , the year they prepare for the ex@@ am again as a graduate student is critic@@ ally important for them as well .
because most graduate students and their families see &quot; that &quot; year as a last chance , which creates greater stress .
revision is the study that students do not like ; they do it because they feel obliged to do it ; and therefore they always postpone it to the last moment ; but it becomes completely a duty for the students that do it regularly and make it a ha@@ bit ; and there is always a plan for what and when things need to be done .
now we have a mid @-@ term break ahead of us and we have to use it in the best way possible .
to do this , we should always have a plan that allows us to manage our time well .
studying for L@@ ess@@ ons during mid @-@ term break :
f@@ ir@@ st@@ ly , everyone should make a plan su@@ itable to their situation .
1 . they should include what they have covered , what are the in@@ complete subjects in their plan and they should plan their days , weeks and 15 @-@ day periods .
there should be both les@@ son revision and question solving in this period .
in the meantime , students that do not have any in@@ complete subjects can solve 1 or 2 mo@@ ck ex@@ ams on average .
deal with Y@@ our In@@ complete subjects : Studies show that people forget 75 percent of what they learn in a week , 66 percent in a day , and 54 percent in an hour .
the best and most effective method of eliminating this ten@@ den@@ cy to forget is by doing revision .
especially students who make too many er@@ r@@ ors in prior lessons should con@@ c@@ entr@@ ate on studying with general revision .
f@@ ir@@ st@@ ly , determine what are the in@@ complete subjects and make your plan everyday ; choose one les@@ son everyday and completely deal with it .
this planning will help you in both academic and psychological situations .
when adding subjects to your plan , pay attention to the subjects you make the most er@@ r@@ ors in .
because there will be no long holiday periods in the future .
solve Qu@@ es@@ tions :
question solving is as important as re@@ vis@@ ing lessons .
because we can see how much we understand the subjects we study only through the fe@@ ed@@ back from the questions we solve .
do not forget to selec@@ t a number of questions to be solved each day .
the number of questions you solve may change in line with what you study ; you may not solve many questions on a day that you mostly study lessons , but we should still solve questions to a certain extent , at least in order to see how much we learned from the les@@ son of that day .
solve Mo@@ ck ex@@ ams :
another area of study to look into during mid @-@ term break should be solving mo@@ ck ex@@ ams .
even if all the subjects are not finished , you can solve mo@@ ck ex@@ ams at least for each les@@ son .
S@@ up@@ pos@@ ing that you finished a Turkish les@@ son , you can solve a 40 @-@ question mo@@ ck ex@@ am of Turkish .
you should definitely keep track of time while doing this .
if you solve 40 Turkish questions in 60 minutes , your next target should be to complete it several minutes faster .
vacation and ho@@ b@@ by Plan@@ s :
of course , a break does not only mean studying for lessons , you should spar@@ e a few days for vacation , to rest and spend time on your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es .
a holiday period spent only studying for lessons will stop you from having f@@ un and rela@@ xing .
for this reason , there should be special time set aside for yo@@ ur@@ self .
reading books , watching television or sur@@ f@@ ing the internet may be in your plans , but the most important thing is how much time you spar@@ e for each activity .
I have some advice for those who say that I could not spend the first term e@@ ff@@ ic@@ i@@ ently .
if you can say that I could not spend the first term well , I could not study much and I missed many lessons , this mid @-@ term break is a big opportunity for you as well .
nevertheless , you should f@@ ir@@ st@@ ly decide on and believe this .
most of the goals in the 2009 @-@ 2010 Turkish Su@@ per League were scored between minutes 76 and 90 .
now , answer the question you ask ; do you go to the loc@@ ker room after the end of the match or is the match still continuing and is there enough time for you to score a goal ?
I sup@@ pose that no one wants to say , &quot; we will look forward to our next match , &quot; a conventional expression used by the coach or players of a losing football team .
now , the only thing you should do is look forward and let go of the past , and run instead of w@@ al@@ k@@ ing .
to sum@@ mar@@ ize what we said :
1 ) F@@ ir@@ st@@ ly make a mid @-@ term break plan ,
2 ) re@@ vis@@ e the lessons you know ,
3 ) Fin@@ ish any in@@ complete subjects ,
4 ) con@@ sol@@ id@@ ate what you have learned by solving questions ,
5 ) Sol@@ ve mo@@ ck ex@@ ams ,
6 ) Re@@ ad books ,
7 ) determine new goals for next term ,
8 ) S@@ par@@ e time for you , your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es and the things you enjoy ,
9 ) S@@ par@@ e time for your family and your friends ,
10 ) S@@ par@@ e time for social and cultural activities ( cinema , sport , theatre , concert , travel , pic@@ n@@ ics , et@@ c . )
&quot; Ker@@ van &quot; took to the road
the founder of Ker@@ van , one of the biggest &quot; home &quot; chain stores in Turkey with 45 stores of 1@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 square meters on average , Å@@ in@@ asi Dem@@ i@@ rel and his son Hasan have now incorpor@@ ated Home S@@ we@@ et Home , which has 17 stores abroad and 25 stores here in Turkey .
with the recent completion of trade registry procedures , Ker@@ van is now the owner of 17 Home S@@ we@@ et Home stores abroad .
st@@ at@@ ing that there are still no Ker@@ van stores abroad , Å@@ in@@ asi Dem@@ i@@ rel said , &quot; F@@ ro@@ m now on , we will continue with big re@@ ta@@ iling with Ker@@ van and smaller re@@ ta@@ iling with Home S@@ we@@ et Home . &quot;
&quot; Ker@@ van will also expand abroad . &quot;
a retail chain and producer with a tur@@ n@@ over of 140 million Turkish L@@ ir@@ a was created with the mer@@ ger of Home S@@ we@@ et Home , with a 50 million Turkish L@@ ir@@ a tur@@ n@@ over , and Ker@@ van , with a 90 million Turkish L@@ ir@@ a tur@@ n@@ over in 2015 .
Ker@@ van &apos;s total retail area , with 45 stores in 35 prov@@ inc@@ es , is 45 thousand square metres .
25 of the stores belong to the par@@ ent company .
there are around 500 people employed by Ker@@ van .
home S@@ we@@ et Home has 25 stores in Turkey and 17 stores abroad , its total retail area is 6@@ 500 square metres , and its number of employees is around 3@@ 20 .
carrying out production , export and re@@ ta@@ iling with his partner A@@ le@@ v P@@ ak@@ ten , Home S@@ we@@ et Home &apos;s Chairman , K@@ adi@@ r Kal@@ ay@@ c@@ Ä±@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u stated that they are very happy with the mer@@ ger with Ker@@ van and added , &quot; We are from Mar@@ din and entered this sector in 1998 . &quot;
from the very beginning , we created a brand with the support of Mr. Å@@ in@@ asi .
Mr. Å@@ in@@ asi is like the &quot; T@@ R@@ T &quot; of this sector .
we learned a lot from him as well .
moreover , we took our first steps in retail when he gave us his store in Ak@@ mer@@ ke@@ z .
in fact , we were working with Ker@@ van as a stra@@ te@@ gical partner , not a rival .
&quot; from now on , a very important sy@@ ner@@ gy will emerge with this mer@@ ger . &quot;
Kal@@ ay@@ c@@ Ä±@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u explained that there are 17 Home S@@ we@@ et Home stores abroad , most of which are in the Middle East ; and they started exports to China last month .
Kal@@ ay@@ c@@ Ä±@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u said , &quot; We opened our first cor@@ ner in S@@ han@@ g@@ ha@@ i . &quot;
we agreed with a chain store which has 200 stores .
&quot; from now on , we will develop big re@@ ta@@ iling as Ker@@ van and small re@@ ta@@ iling with Home S@@ we@@ et Home abroad . &quot;

he said , &quot; I@@ f you ask from where the name P@@ la@@ di@@ s comes , actually the name has no special meaning &quot; and added :
Az@@ tec@@ s called it M@@ ay@@ a .
Japanese people , S@@ ub@@ ar@@ u , Per@@ v@@ in in Iran .
S@@ Ã¼@@ re@@ y@@ ya in Ara@@ bic ; we gained in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation from the name of the star cl@@ us@@ ter , P@@ le@@ i@@ ade@@ s , which is made up of seven stars and means Ã@@ l@@ ker in Latin .
and so , we translated Ã@@ l@@ ker g@@ lob@@ ally .

with their names being written in gold letters in the games world , the series of games by Ac@@ ti@@ vision , In@@ fin@@ ity W@@ ard , T@@ re@@ y@@ ar@@ ch and S@@ le@@ d@@ ge@@ ham@@ mer Games seem not to be forgotten for many years .
the newly announced sales figures especially prove how much we should find this series legendary .
Ac@@ ti@@ vision , who hold the licen@@ cing rights of the series , showed that 250 million cop@@ ies were sold in the end of tear special sales issue .
sharing the sales figures for all the series at the beginning of last year , the company succeeded in selling 75 million cop@@ ies of the game C@@ all of D@@ ut@@ y from that time to now .

Kemal K@@ Ä±@@ l@@ Ä±@@ Ã§@@ dar@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u was elected as General President again
Kemal K@@ Ä±@@ l@@ Ä±@@ Ã§@@ dar@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u was elected as the general president again in the regular congress .
receiving the votes of 9@@ 90 delegates out of 12@@ 38 , K@@ Ä±@@ l@@ Ä±@@ Ã§@@ dar@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u became general president again .
2@@ 48 of the votes cast were declared n@@ ul@@ l and vo@@ id .
party members che@@ ered after the results were announced .
CHP had 12@@ 75 delegates in total .
the congress finished its en@@ de@@ av@@ ours and gathered at 10 : 00@@ am on Sunday .
in the congress , K@@ Ä±@@ l@@ Ä±@@ Ã§@@ dar@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u stated the following in his sum@@ m@@ ary :
we would have lik@@ ed people to dance and sing folk songs here .
however , where we stand now is under@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
the reality is that Turkey could not be govern@@ ed .
the resulting atmosphere over@@ sha@@ do@@ ws all of that .
the cause of the p@@ es@@ si@@ mis@@ m is those who are governing the country .
as a member of CHP , we are against terror no matter where it comes from .
terror is a crime against humanity and the terrorists should not be for@@ given .
the fight against terrorism is carried out with intelligence , knowledge and comp@@ re@@ hen@@ sion .
we certainly want to fight against it , and we want everybody to be un@@ touched .
what is the difference between the photo@@ graph@@ s from the Southeast and the photo@@ graph@@ s from Syria and Lebanon ?
when they came to the table , they made serious mistakes .
the government is responsible for all the blo@@ od@@ shed , te@@ ars and victims .
they took over this country with zero terrorism in 2002 , but today Turkey has turned into a blo@@ od@@ b@@ ath .
who is responsible for them ?
the taxi driver Å@@ e@@ h@@ mu@@ z in D@@ i@@ y@@ ar@@ bak@@ Ä±@@ r ?
for what does Turkey pay the price ?
we will participate gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely in the meetings to change the coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at laws , we will offer our opinions .
we won &apos;t let any@@ body build a country on their personal views .
I say , &quot; L@@ et &apos;s change the pro @-@ coup min@@ d@@ set . &quot;
the houses of this country &apos;s intellectuals are ra@@ i@@ ded and they are taken into custody because they gave their opinion .
there are parts of what they say we do not agree with , but people should be able to offer their opinions freely .
this tin@@ po@@ t dictator says , &quot; Th@@ ose who benefit from the state , treat it as an en@@ em@@ y . &quot;
I would also like to ask him ; those who benefit from the state , and use all the opportunities of the state , why don &apos;t they think about it when they ro@@ b the country ?
CHP is the party that brought the biggest changes to this country .
we will make preparations together for the fourth biggest revolution .
we will definitely bring liber@@ tar@@ ian democracy to this country no matter what it costs .
they may de@@ tain us , they may take us into custody ; CHP will bring freedom to this country no matter what they do , no matter how heavy the price .
I &apos;m making a clear , stra@@ ight call to you , D@@ av@@ ut@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u .
do not hide behind the coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at laws , those who hide behind them do not ban@@ ish from one &apos;s mind the coup mentality .
you gave a mer@@ it@@ or@@ ious service medal to someone who gave a warning to you .
which coup are you talking about ?
it is completely aimed at de@@ ce@@ i@@ ving the people .
party officials listed the other 3 revol@@ utions as follows : the 1st big revolution is the foundation of the Republic by putting an end to the s@@ ul@@ tan@@ ate ; the 2nd big revolution is the passing from the single party era to the multi @-@ party era in the time of Ä°@@ n@@ Ã¶@@ n@@ Ã¼ ; the 3rd big revolution is passing into social democracy with B@@ Ã¼@@ l@@ ent E@@ c@@ ev@@ it ...
there are qu@@ al@@ if@@ ic@@ ations and duties of the President .
there is a President &apos;s o@@ ath in article 1@@ 03 .
we know how important the con@@ cep@@ ts of hon@@ es@@ ty and honour are in this society .
if someone comes out and gives this promise , they should keep their word to the death .
because hon@@ es@@ ty and honour are in@@ dis@@ p@@ ut@@ able for us .
what do hon@@ es@@ ty and honour mean for you , tin@@ po@@ t dictator ?
what do you understand from hon@@ es@@ ty and honour , why did you take this o@@ ath ?
what do hon@@ es@@ ty and honour mean to you ?
I want to learn this .
the con@@ cep@@ ts of hon@@ es@@ ty and honour are held in high es@@ te@@ em by religious people .
their intention is not to abolish the law of the coup , but to for@@ ti@@ fy the law of the coup .
it does not su@@ ff@@ ic@@ e and they want the presidential system .
what kind of presidency ; it is a presidential system with a bos@@ s .
why do you reject the Ottoman parliamentary system ?
one person comman@@ ds and everybody does what is necessary .
do we have a healthy parliament in Turkey that works ?
no , it does not work .
if we bring liber@@ tar@@ ian democracy , the system will work .
they repeatedly say coup but they are strengthening the law of the coup .
declaring his nomination for candidacy of the general presidency , Ä°@@ z@@ mir Deputy Mustafa Bal@@ b@@ ay could not join the race because he could not gather the signatures of 1@@ 28 delegates necessary for the candidacy .
gathering 92 signatures , Bal@@ b@@ ay said , &quot; I am not able to become a candidate under present conditions . &quot;
the thing that attracted attention was that the previous CHP leader D@@ en@@ iz B@@ ay@@ k@@ al sat in the tri@@ bun@@ es with party members instead of the seats allocated to deputies and members of the party council ( P@@ M ) , the central executive board ( M@@ Y@@ K ) and hon@@ or@@ ary board .
Istanbul deputy G@@ Ã¼@@ lay Y@@ e@@ de@@ k@@ Ã§@@ i arrived early and sat near the section allocated to the General President K@@ Ä±@@ l@@ Ä±@@ Ã§@@ dar@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u instead of sitting in the area allocated to the deputies .
one of the things most spoken about in the back@@ stage of the congress was the conversation between K@@ l@@ Ä±@@ Ã§@@ dar@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u and the Y@@ al@@ ova deputy Mu@@ har@@ re@@ m Ä°@@ n@@ ce .
Ä°@@ n@@ ce explained that membership of the party council was offered to him , but he did not accept it .
however , sources from central office claim that the meeting request came from Ä°@@ n@@ ce and membership of the party council was not offered to him .
In@@ ce shared a message on T@@ w@@ it@@ ter , &quot; No matter who they are , the sources from the central office can get the details of the conversation from the Istanbul deputy Ali Ã@@ z@@ can . &quot;
Ã@@ z@@ can said , &quot; Ho@@ w can I know about the conversation between two people . &quot;
he only said , &quot; he went and spoke with him . &quot;
K@@ Ä±@@ l@@ Ä±@@ Ã§@@ dar@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u &apos;s son appla@@ u@@ ded his &quot; father &quot; repeatedly .
the back@@ stage of the party council left its mark on the first day of the ordinary &quot; Congress of Democracy , C@@ han@@ ge and Bro@@ ther@@ hood . &quot;
after his speech at the congress , K@@ Ä±@@ l@@ Ä±@@ Ã§@@ dar@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u went to his home and started to work on the list of party council .
it was understood that while preparing the key list of 100 people , he called the 13 central executive board ( M@@ Y@@ K ) members and said he would include them in the list ; except for the current central executive board members Y@@ ak@@ up Ak@@ k@@ ay@@ a , Sen@@ c@@ er A@@ y@@ at@@ a and Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ a@@ Å , who declared that they did not want to be on the executive and did not apply for the party council ( P@@ M ) , and S@@ ey@@ han Er@@ do@@ Ä@@ d@@ u , who applied once more to the party council .
it is stated that K@@ Ä±@@ l@@ Ä±@@ Ã§@@ dar@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u may refer to another narrow list in addition to the 100 person @-@ key list of the party council .
in the 21 article @-@ final declaration , accepted unanimously at the CHP congress , the ab@@ ol@@ is@@ hment of the ann@@ ot@@ ation on the European Charter of Local Sel@@ f @-@ Government was requested , which was brought into the agenda with the self government discussions of D@@ T@@ K , and the increase of the authority share in the local affairs .
In@@ cle@@ ded in the declaration were the aims of &quot; ending of the party state system &quot; and &quot; establishment of a transparent and accountable rule of law . &quot;
Vice Chairman of the A@@ K Party S@@ el@@ Ã§@@ uk Ã@@ z@@ da@@ Ä , Ä°@@ dri@@ s Bal@@ uk@@ en from H@@ DP and Ru@@ h@@ sa@@ r Dem@@ i@@ rel from MHP watched the congress .
A@@ K Party member Ã@@ z@@ da@@ Ä and the delegation from the A@@ K Party left the hall when K@@ Ä±@@ l@@ Ä±@@ Ã§@@ dar@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u har@@ sh@@ ly cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed President Er@@ do@@ Ä@@ an .
Ã@@ z@@ da@@ Ä said , &quot; I saw that he knows no boundaries of cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ ing , it was not possible for me to accept it . &quot;
the ban@@ ner with photos of the arrested journalists C@@ an D@@ Ã¼@@ n@@ dar and Er@@ dem G@@ Ã¼@@ l and the text &quot; I@@ f I don &apos;t bur@@ n , if you don &apos;t bur@@ n , if we don &apos;t bur@@ n , how will the light van@@ qu@@ ish the d@@ ark@@ ness ? , &quot; and the ban@@ ner of &quot; Peace &quot; in English , Turkish and Kurdish attracted attention in the hall .
the congress started in the morning with the songs of Group Y@@ or@@ um and Ahmet K@@ ay@@ a .
there was big appla@@ use for the message sent by T@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ k@@ an El@@ Ã§@@ i , wife of the Bar president of D@@ i@@ y@@ ar@@ bak@@ Ä±@@ r Ta@@ hi@@ r El@@ Ã§@@ i , who was killed in an armed assault .
Ber@@ kin El@@ van &apos;s mother G@@ Ã¼@@ l@@ s@@ Ã¼@@ m and father Sam@@ i El@@ van also participated in the congress .
the most appla@@ u@@ ded part of the speech was the part in which K@@ Ä±@@ l@@ Ä±@@ Ã§@@ dar@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u said that they will em@@ br@@ ace democracy &quot; to the death &quot; no matter what price they have to pay .
having assemb@@ led 34 ordinary and 18 extraordinary con@@ gres@@ ses , 52 con@@ gres@@ ses in total until now , CHP assemb@@ led the 5@@ 3rd big congress in Ankara Ar@@ ena y@@ es@@ ter@@ day .
participation was high .
there were more than 15 thousand CHP members in the hall with a capacity of 12 thousand seats .
however , the crowd didn &apos;t do justice to this number with their en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m .
the most ex@@ citing moment was the moment in which K@@ Ä±@@ l@@ Ä±@@ Ã§@@ dar@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u entered the hall with his wife Sel@@ v@@ i K@@ Ä±@@ l@@ Ä±@@ Ã§@@ dar@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u .
the ex@@ ci@@ te@@ ment continued when the K@@ Ä±@@ l@@ Ä±@@ Ã§@@ dar@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u couple greeted the hall with a wave .
there is no tr@@ ace of the discipline seen in the con@@ gres@@ ses of the A@@ K Party .
there was a lot of movement in the ground area of the arena even when K@@ Ä±@@ l@@ Ä±@@ Ã§@@ dar@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u was making speech .
it was obvious that the CHP members , wan@@ ting to enter the Party Council , pre@@ fer@@ red to seek support by talking about themselves to party ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tives and journalists .
one of the CHP ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tives tried to explain that this situation was not a bad thing by saying , &quot; It is better than sitting down without moving and lining up the walk @-@ on party members as in the party meetings of Korea or the Soviet Union . &quot;
the CHP congress has one more difference from the con@@ gres@@ ses of the A@@ K Party or MHP .
in these parties , only the general president talks .
in CHP , the congress becomes a platform in which the problems of the party are discussed .
when the number of party members wan@@ ting to speak increased , Council Chairman Mur@@ at Kar@@ ay@@ al@@ Ã§@@ Ä±@@ n had di@@ ff@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty in adjust@@ ing the time .
there was the expression &quot; The home@@ land goes bad &quot; in their faces , and there was a distance to the comments &quot; Y@@ ou will then change this course of events with the result coming from this hall . &quot;
all the CHP members said , &quot; So@@ me@@ thing should be done , &quot; but there wasn &apos;t a strong and co@@ her@@ ent answer to the question of &quot; Wh@@ at should be done . &quot;
the fact that there will be no election in the next 4 years had a big effect on the situation .
when K@@ Ä±@@ l@@ Ä±@@ Ã§@@ dar@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u went up to the ros@@ tru@@ m , we journalists w@@ ai@@ ted for his answer to the question &quot; Wh@@ at should be done . &quot;
f@@ ir@@ st@@ ly , K@@ Ä±@@ l@@ Ä±@@ Ã§@@ dar@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u ans@@ w@@ ered the question &quot; what is going on . &quot;
he highlighted the issue of the arrested journalists , what was done to academics because of the declaration , what took place in the southeast , the deadlock that foreign policy has come to .
he repeatedly ans@@ w@@ ered the &quot; le@@ gen@@ ds of An@@ at@@ ol@@ ia &quot; issue related to his CHP party , such as , &quot; it is a party of non @-@ be@@ li@@ e@@ ver@@ s , &quot; &quot; it supports cou@@ ps d &apos;@@ Ã©@@ t@@ at &quot; and &quot; it is the party of eli@@ ti@@ sts . &quot;
when it comes to the &quot; Wh@@ at should be done &quot; stage , he tried to put forward a &quot; strategy &quot; rather than discussing concrete steps .
he stressed that all of these problems could be overcome with a stronger democracy and more justice .
he gave a promise on behalf of CHP and said , &quot; We will work no matter what it costs until we bring democracy . &quot;
&quot; we will struggle to the death for democracy . &quot;
one last note : it is necessary to remember that CHP have solved the issue of &quot; organiz@@ ation &quot; as of the 5@@ 3rd congress , and it now succe@@ eds in assemb@@ ling a congress without problem .
on another note , cards were pr@@ in@@ ted for 900 journalists said to be attending the congress , but journalist participation in the hall was not at that level .
representatives of media organiz@@ ations from Ankara were not as e@@ ag@@ er as they were for the con@@ gres@@ ses of the A@@ K Party .
life sentence was demanded for autonomy
the indictment , prepared by the Chief Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office against 7 suspects , 3 of whom are in detention , was accepted by the 4th High Criminal Court .
in the indictment , it was stated that declar@@ ations under the name of &quot; autonomy &quot; were made in some districts and ne@@ igh@@ bour@@ ho@@ ods of D@@ i@@ y@@ ar@@ bak@@ Ä±@@ r , Ä°@@ stan@@ bu@@ l , Å@@ Ä±@@ r@@ n@@ ak , Mar@@ din , Mu@@ Å , H@@ ak@@ kar@@ i , Si@@ ir@@ t , B@@ it@@ lis , B@@ at@@ man , Van and A@@ Ä@@ r@@ Ä± upon the direc@@ tions and calls by senior ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tives of the terrorist organiz@@ ation PKK / K@@ C@@ K .
indi@@ c@@ ating that there were calls for illegal actions by the r@@ ing@@ leaders and the youth and woman for@@ ma@@ tions of the organiz@@ ation , the indictment noted that there was an increase in the actions of bombing , long bar@@ re@@ l@@ led we@@ ap@@ on and roc@@ ket la@@ un@@ cher attacks on the security forces , public institutions and organiz@@ ations and people &apos;s houses , work@@ places and vehicles in the S@@ ur , B@@ a@@ Ä@@ lar , Sil@@ van , Bis@@ m@@ il , L@@ ice , D@@ ic@@ le and H@@ az@@ ro districts of D@@ i@@ y@@ ar@@ bak@@ Ä±@@ r .
Is@@ is clashed with opponents ; our police station was hit
the clashes recently seen between Is@@ is and the Army of Con@@ quest , formed by a group of rebel mil@@ iti@@ as , are becoming violent and continue in the Syrian villages of Du@@ di@@ yan , Q@@ ar@@ ah M@@ az@@ r &apos;@@ ah , B@@ ag@@ hi@@ din and Q@@ ar@@ ah K@@ ub@@ ri on the op@@ pos@@ ite side of the Y@@ av@@ uz@@ l@@ u village of Kil@@ is .
during the clashes between Is@@ is and its opponents close to the border , gun@@ fire and the no@@ ise of mor@@ tar@@ s can also be heard in Turkey .
coming from the region in which ex@@ pl@@ os@@ ions occur frequently , smoke could be seen from Turkey with the n@@ ak@@ ed eye , and security forces took con@@ c@@ ent@@ rated prec@@ au@@ tions with ar@@ m@@ oured cars on the border .
on the other hand , har@@ ass@@ ment fire was opened from the B@@ ag@@ hi@@ din village under the control of Is@@ is militants at the M@@ art@@ y@@ r Mehmet Police St@@ ation on the border near the Y@@ av@@ uz@@ l@@ u Vil@@ la@@ ge in Kil@@ is .
then , soldiers responded to the area from which the har@@ ass@@ ment fire was coming , with ho@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er and heavy guns within the rules of engagement .
according to claims , Russian war@@ planes organiz@@ ed an attack on the village of H@@ a@@ me@@ y@@ in , which is 17 kil@@ o@@ metres from the Turkish border .
wounded by the a@@ er@@ ial bombing , 6 Sy@@ ri@@ ans were brought to the state hospital of Kil@@ is by relatives .

i@@ O@@ S 9 : how to get new i@@ Ph@@ one operating system , as Ap@@ ple up@@ date is released
the new operating system can be requested by heading to the sett@@ ings ap@@ p , t@@ apping &quot; General , &quot; and then selec@@ ting &quot; Sof@@ tw@@ are up@@ date . &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone will give you the option to down@@ lo@@ ad and then in@@ st@@ all it .
some have run into problems after that instal@@ lation , being hit by an er@@ ror message telling them that &quot; Sof@@ tw@@ are up@@ date failed . &quot;
to get around that , users are recommended either to wait for the r@@ us@@ h to die down , or to try and upgrade through i@@ Tun@@ es .
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
that might include de@@ le@@ ting Ap@@ ps to make space - but Ap@@ ple has made that less likely by s@@ li@@ m@@ ming down the up@@ date , and also easier to do using a special tool that will suggest Ap@@ ps to de@@ le@@ te and then re @-@ in@@ st@@ all them once the process is over .
it &apos;s worth ensuring that your phone is charged or near a char@@ ger while the up@@ date happens , so that it doesn &apos;t run out of bat@@ tery .
if the charge is too low , Ap@@ ple won &apos;t let the up@@ date go ahead , since the phone d@@ ying hal@@ f@@ way through could lead to the up@@ date breaking .

F@@ ed@@ E@@ x ear@@ nings mixed , lo@@ w@@ ers fiscal 20@@ 16 outlook
F@@ ed@@ E@@ x reported dis@@ appointing results for its latest quarter , and the delivery giant cut its full @-@ year profit forecast on we@@ aker demand for fre@@ ight services and higher costs in its ground division .
the company also said it plans to h@@ ire about 5@@ 5,000 se@@ as@@ onal workers for the holidays .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ E@@ x announced it would h@@ ire 50,000 se@@ as@@ onal workers for the holidays .
its shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes ahead of Wednesday &apos;s opening bel@@ l .
F@@ ed@@ E@@ x Cor@@ p@@ . said that it expects to earn between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 for the fiscal year that ends next May , down 20 c@@ ents from an earlier pre@@ di@@ ction .
analysts expected $ 10.@@ 84 , according to a survey by Fac@@ t@@ S@@ et .
the reduced outlook comes despite rate hikes aver@@ aging 4.@@ 9 percent , which will take effect Jan@@ . 4 , and higher sur@@ charges for ground ship@@ ment of heavy or large p@@ ack@@ ages , which begin in November .
the company said it still expects ear@@ nings to grow over the previous year because of cost @-@ cutting , higher revenue and growth in online com@@ m@@ er@@ ce .
chairman and CEO F@@ red S@@ mit@@ h said the company was &quot; performing sol@@ id@@ ly given we@@ aker @-@ than @-@ expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the holiday @-@ h@@ ir@@ ing plans were announced a day after rival U@@ P@@ S said that that it plans to h@@ ire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , about the same that it hired last year .
in the quarter that ended A@@ ug@@ . 31 , F@@ ed@@ E@@ x earned $ 6@@ 92 million , up 6 percent from a year earlier .
ear@@ nings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 , short of the $ 2.@@ 44 per share average forecast of 12 analysts surveyed by Z@@ ac@@ ks Investment Research .
revenue rose 5 percent , to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts surveyed by Z@@ ac@@ ks expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ E@@ x has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping , which has caused revenue in its Express unit to st@@ ag@@ n@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has boosted results at F@@ ed@@ E@@ x Gro@@ un@@ d .
in the latest quarter , ground revenue rose 29 percent but operating income was bas@@ ically flat on higher costs for larger p@@ ack@@ ages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit saw higher income because of higher base rates , while income fell in the fre@@ ight business on higher la@@ b@@ or costs .
in pre@@ market trading about an hour before the opening bel@@ l , F@@ ed@@ E@@ x shares were down $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
they closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at their most anticipated meeting in years , Federal Res@@ er@@ ve pol@@ ic@@ y@@ makers will spend two days this week se@@ ated around a 27 @-@ fo@@ ot Hon@@ dur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ g@@ any table deciding if it &apos;s time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade .
lo@@ om@@ ing over them at one end of the central bank &apos;s or@@ n@@ ate , two @-@ story bo@@ ard@@ room will be a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a remin@@ der that F@@ ed Cha@@ ir@@ woman Jan@@ et L@@ . Y@@ el@@ len and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation &apos;s economic interests above all others .
the central bank has a dual charge from Congress : ma@@ x@@ im@@ ize U@@ .@@ S@@ . employment and keep prices here stable .
but since the Great recession , F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there &apos;s an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and that third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a too @-@ close @-@ to @-@ predict decision , to be announced Thursday , about whether the U@@ .@@ S@@ . economy is ready to start being we@@ an@@ ed from the unprecedented sti@@ mul@@ us provided by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate in place since late 2008 .
even though most data show the economy growing sol@@ id@@ ly , the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already @-@ cautious F@@ ed officials s@@ k@@ it@@ ti@@ s@@ h about adding to the v@@ ola@@ ti@@ li@@ ty by raising their ben@@ ch@@ mark federal funds rate - even by no more than a m@@ ere quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; obviously the la@@ b@@ or market and inflation is going to be first and fore@@ most the most important thing they watch , &quot; said L@@ in@@ d@@ se@@ y M@@ . Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief economist at bro@@ k@@ er@@ age firm Sti@@ f@@ el Nic@@ ola@@ us &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for an ex@@ c@@ use not to raise the rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global m@@ ark@@ et@@ place is enough to provide them with justi@@ fication to wait further , &quot; she said .
there &apos;s no consensus about what the F@@ ed will do , which in itself is causing financial market j@@ it@@ ters .
about half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate increase this week .
financial markets , however , are expecting the F@@ ed to hold off , with a key indi@@ c@@ ator showing only about a 30 % chance of a boost .
that would point to a stock market drop if the F@@ ed raises the rate , unless pol@@ ic@@ y@@ makers were to so@@ f@@ ten the blow by promising that another increase would be a ways off .
on Tuesday , the Do@@ w Jones industrial average jum@@ ped 2@@ 2@@ 8.@@ 8@@ 9 points , or 1.4 % , to 16@@ ,@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the rally was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed pol@@ ic@@ y@@ makers will hold the rate steady this week , said John L@@ on@@ ski , chief economist at Moody &apos;s Capital Mar@@ kets Research Group .
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed hi@@ ked rates at this point in time , &quot; he said .
if F@@ ed pol@@ ic@@ y@@ makers did , &quot; they would have to go to great len@@ g@@ ths in their policy statement to hold financial markets &apos; hands so they don &apos;t pan@@ ic . &quot;
other experts argued that a rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
just a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage point this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ ten@@ ing of monetary conditions that would val@@ id@@ ate the strength of the U@@ .@@ S@@ . recovery .
Y@@ el@@ len had said through the spring and early summer that she expected a rate increase this year despite complaints from liber@@ als that more economic progress was needed .
although job creation slowed in August , la@@ b@@ or market growth has been solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed considers to be full employment .
wage gains have shown signs of pic@@ king up .
and although inflation continued to run below the central bank &apos;s annual 2 % target , F@@ ed pol@@ ic@@ y@@ makers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher rates , and needs them , given the tigh@@ t@@ ness of the la@@ b@@ or market , &quot; said I@@ an She@@ ph@@ er@@ d@@ son , chief economist at Pan@@ the@@ on ma@@ c@@ ro@@ economics .
but financial markets around the world started con@@ v@@ ul@@ sing late last month after China dev@@ al@@ u@@ ed its currency .
the Do@@ w Jones industrial average dropped as much as 16 % below its record high in May as investors f@@ ear@@ ed a s@@ lo@@ w@@ ing Chinese economy would dra@@ g down global growth .
the market has re@@ bo@@ un@@ ded somewhat this month , with the Do@@ w now down nearly 10 % from the May high .
for F@@ ed pol@@ ic@@ y@@ makers , the market turmoil adds to the complex cal@@ cul@@ us of when to raise the interest rate .
&quot; ab@@ sent what happened in financial markets and the news about the weak@@ ness in the Chinese economy over the past couple weeks , they would be tigh@@ ten@@ ing at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D@@ . O@@ lin@@ er , a senior research fellow at the U@@ C@@ L@@ A Z@@ im@@ an Center for Re@@ al E@@ state and a former F@@ ed official .
now , he predicts they &apos;ll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects .
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty about what the imp@@ acts on the U@@ .@@ S@@ . economy are going to be , and they have almost no data to rely on that post @-@ dates the developments in China , &quot; O@@ lin@@ er said .
the health of the global economy isn &apos;t one of the F@@ ed &apos;s primary concerns , so technically it shouldn &apos;t be fac@@ to@@ red into its decision @-@ making .
but , in effect , the F@@ ed has become the monetary authority of the world .
the central bank &apos;s influence in recent years has been enormous .
the m@@ ere hin@@ t by then @-@ Chairman B@@ en S@@ . Ber@@ n@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the F@@ ed might &quot; t@@ ap@@ er &quot; its monetary expansion triggered market con@@ v@@ ul@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed officials can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to cons@@ ul@@ t with other central ban@@ kers and experts to get a better read on the global economy .
its decision @-@ making process is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of global strategy for wealth @-@ management firm En@@ v@@ est@@ net In@@ c .
J@@ e@@ ff@@ re@@ y L@@ ack@@ er , president of the Federal Res@@ er@@ ve Bank of R@@ ic@@ h@@ mon@@ d , V@@ a . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reac@@ ting to financial market movements that seem un@@ connected to economic fun@@ da@@ men@@ t@@ als . &quot;
L@@ ack@@ er , a voting member of the pol@@ ic@@ y@@ making Federal Open Market Committee who has been pushing for a rate increase , cited decisions in 1998 @-@ 99 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to cut its ben@@ ch@@ mark rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage point over three meetings &quot; despite limited identi@@ fi@@ able implications for U@@ .@@ S@@ . growth , &quot; L@@ ack@@ er said .
a year later , F@@ ed officials rever@@ sed those cuts .
the F@@ ed should put financial stability concerns first only during a major crisis , such as the 2008 market mel@@ t@@ down , said A@@ dam S@@ . P@@ os@@ en , a former member of the Bank of England &apos;s rate @-@ setting committee .
the latest turmoil doesn &apos;t come close to that level , he said .
&quot; you certainly don &apos;t want to be put in a situation of being scar@@ ed of a rate hike because markets got up@@ set , &quot; said P@@ os@@ en , president of the Pet@@ er@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Res@@ er@@ ve Ac@@ t still has the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think they should get ahead of the cur@@ ve .

Bra@@ z@@ il@@ ian pe@@ di@@ at@@ ric organiz@@ ation S@@ P@@ RS has come up with a sho@@ c@@ king way to try and get women to understand the importance of good n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion while bre@@ ast@@ fe@@ eding , by featuring images of ba@@ bi@@ es suc@@ k@@ ling from bre@@ asts pain@@ ted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food .
human bre@@ ast milk is composed of a variety of pro@@ te@@ ins , f@@ ats , v@@ it@@ am@@ ins , and car@@ bo@@ hy@@ dra@@ tes , which give ba@@ bi@@ es all the n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ents they need to grow a strong im@@ m@@ un@@ e system .
due to ex@@ cess energy requirements , pre@@ gn@@ ant women and new m@@ om@@ s are advised to increase their daily cal@@ or@@ ie in@@ take by about 500 cal@@ or@@ ies per day .
however , new research suggests that increasing cal@@ or@@ ie in@@ take is not the only di@@ et@@ ary adjustment mo@@ thers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert W@@ ater@@ land , a professor at the B@@ ay@@ l@@ or Col@@ le@@ ge of Medi@@ c@@ ine in T@@ ex@@ as revealed that healthy di@@ ets of pre@@ gn@@ ant women actually affected the gen@@ etic expression of their ba@@ bi@@ es and protected them from developing t@@ um@@ ors .

&quot; from the moment I w@@ al@@ k@@ ed into the house , reading ( Sar@@ ah &apos;s ) energy and S@@ am &apos;s energy I felt like they were quite compatible and I kept thinking that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ f@@ el@@ lo@@ ws .
&quot; Sar@@ ah is really down to ear@@ th , she &apos;s so much f@@ un to be around , &quot; added Mar@@ k@@ oski .
I &apos;ve seen them together and they do have that chem@@ ist@@ ry there .
they do feel n@@ ice and comfortable with each other .
Sar@@ ah Mac@@ K@@ ay believes she and S@@ am W@@ o@@ od would be well su@@ ited as a couple .
for her part , Mac@@ K@@ ay said last week &apos;s home visit dates made her realise W@@ o@@ od could be &quot; the one . &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family I realised this obviously isn &apos;t just a game - I &apos;m who@@ le@@ he@@ ar@@ te@@ d@@ ly invested in him now , &quot; she said .
and asked who W@@ o@@ od should choose if not her , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a ti@@ e between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .

D@@ et@@ ro@@ it and Se@@ at@@ t@@ le showed p@@ len@@ ty of interest after his move to the US - and there were p@@ len@@ ty of other teams making in@@ qu@@ iri@@ es after his impressive open training day late last year .

Tom@@ s@@ ul@@ a continued to show his true c@@ olo@@ urs in the loc@@ ker room after the game .
instead of che@@ wing out his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ul@@ a also backed H@@ ay@@ ne publicly in his post @-@ match press conference .
4@@ 9@@ ers beat reporter C@@ am In@@ man reported that H@@ ay@@ ne also received en@@ cour@@ a@@ ge@@ ment from special teams co @-@ ordinator T@@ ho@@ mas Mc@@ G@@ a@@ ug@@ he@@ y , who advised him to forget about his dropped catch and worry about the next play .

4 Kil@@ led A@@ f@@ ter Police F@@ ire ru@@ b@@ ber bul@@ le@@ ts at protesters in N@@ ep@@ al
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern N@@ ep@@ al after the police fired ru@@ b@@ ber bul@@ le@@ ts into a crowd demonstrating against the country &apos;s proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence occurred Tuesday evening in the district of R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 1@@ 75 mil@@ es west of K@@ ath@@ man@@ d@@ u , the capital .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ h@@ ak@@ al , the chief district officer , said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station , some of them th@@ ro@@ wing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr. D@@ h@@ ak@@ al said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before res@@ or@@ t@@ ing to ru@@ b@@ ber bul@@ le@@ ts .
twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded , he said .
it was not immediately clear why ru@@ b@@ ber bul@@ le@@ ts , which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less @-@ le@@ th@@ al alternative , apparently produced such a high death toll .
the clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across N@@ ep@@ al &apos;s southern pla@@ ins , where members of the M@@ ad@@ h@@ es@@ i ethnic group say new prov@@ inc@@ es established under the proposed new constitution would dil@@ ute their political influence .
there have also been protests in western N@@ ep@@ al from ethnic T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officials , have been killed in violent clashes since A@@ ug@@ .
10 , when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into prov@@ inc@@ es - a major step toward a new constitution but a highly conten@@ tious issue in N@@ ep@@ al , which has been centr@@ ally govern@@ ed for centuries .
work on a new constitution has been under@@ way since 2008 , but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
lawmakers have been voting on cla@@ uses in the draft constitution in K@@ ath@@ man@@ d@@ u this week , and officials have said that the new charter could be en@@ acted by Sunday .

Google launches donation @-@ mat@@ ching campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
Google In@@ c ( G@@ O@@ O@@ G@@ L@@ .@@ O ) announced a donation @-@ mat@@ ching campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organiz@@ ations ai@@ ding the thousands of refugees that have over@@ wh@@ el@@ med European nations as they flee war @-@ tor@@ n and imp@@ over@@ ished countries .
Google took an un@@ character@@ isti@@ cally personal approach in announcing the donation drive on its blo@@ g .
rather than having an executive make the announcement , R@@ ita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled K@@ ab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experience .
&quot; our journey involved many dark train and bus ri@@ des , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lu@@ cky .
but as the refugee and mig@@ rant crisis in Europe has grown , many people like my family are desper@@ ate for help .
the donations will go toward four non@@ profit organiz@@ ations that are providing aid to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Borders , International Res@@ c@@ ue Committee , S@@ ave the Children and UN High Commissioner for Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said it will match the first $ 5.5 million worth of donations g@@ lob@@ ally at go@@ og@@ le@@ .com / ref@@ u@@ ge@@ er@@ eli@@ ef until it raises $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely driven by the four @-@ year @-@ old civil war in Syria , which has displaced more than 4 million people this year .
many are also fle@@ eing war @-@ tor@@ n Afghanistan , Y@@ e@@ men , Iraq and Libya .

for mil@@ dly ob@@ ese di@@ ab@@ e@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be hel@@ p@@ ful
the benefits of weight loss surgery for mil@@ dly ob@@ ese people with type 2 di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes can last at least five years , according to a new study .
it &apos;s still to early to say whether mil@@ dly ob@@ ese people with di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non @-@ sur@@ gical tre@@ at@@ ments , however .
&quot; the m@@ or@@ t@@ ality data take a long time to show up , &quot; said Dr@@ . R@@ ob@@ in Bla@@ ck@@ stone , a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ ama Sur@@ ger@@ y .
weight loss operations , or bar@@ i@@ at@@ ric surgery , use various methods to sh@@ r@@ ink the size of the sto@@ ma@@ ch .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absor@@ b food .
over the years , bar@@ i@@ at@@ ric sur@@ ger@@ ies have proved effective for tre@@ ating type 2 di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes , but most studies were done in people who are mor@@ bi@@ dly ob@@ ese , with a body mass index ( B@@ M@@ I ) of 35 or above .
B@@ M@@ I , a measure of weight in relation to he@@ ight , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 2@@ 4.@@ 9 .
a B@@ M@@ I of 25 or higher indicates that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a B@@ M@@ I over 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calc@@ ulate your B@@ M@@ I here : 1.@@ u@@ sa@@ .@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from T@@ ai@@ w@@ an &apos;s M@@ in @-@ S@@ hen@@ g General Hospital used data collected since 2007 in a trial compar@@ ing two kinds of bar@@ i@@ at@@ ric surgery - g@@ as@@ tri@@ c by@@ pass and sle@@ eve g@@ ast@@ rec@@ t@@ om@@ y - to medical tre@@ at@@ ments for type 2 di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes in people who were mil@@ dly ob@@ ese .
the average B@@ M@@ I among those who had surgery fell from 31 to 2@@ 4.5 by the end of their fifth year in the study .
meanwhile , the B@@ M@@ I among those receiving non @-@ sur@@ gical di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes tre@@ at@@ ments st@@ ay@@ ed about the same at 29 .
among those who had surgery , di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 percent .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , by comparison , di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent .
in addition , control of blood pressure , tri@@ g@@ l@@ y@@ cer@@ ides , and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ D@@ L cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol &quot; was generally better in the sur@@ gical group , &quot; the authors found .
the researchers also monitored patients &apos; blood levels of h@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c , which reflect blood sugar levels over time .
H@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after surgery , the average h@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical ther@@ ap@@ y group , however , it remained steady at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; g@@ l@@ y@@ c@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected by the improved h@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c levels - did not reduce the m@@ or@@ t@@ ality rate at five years , according to lead researcher Dr@@ . Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ en@@ g H@@ S@@ U and colleagues .
the research team also compared average out@@ comes with the two types of surgery .
at the fifth year , compared to the sle@@ eve g@@ ast@@ rec@@ t@@ om@@ y group , the by@@ pass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 v@@ s 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved larger dro@@ ps in B@@ M@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 v@@ s 5.@@ 1 ) and in h@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.@@ 1 percent v@@ s 2.@@ 1 percent ) and were more likely to have complete di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes re@@ mission ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 percent v@@ s 1@@ 6.@@ 7 percent ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit or surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heav@@ ier people in Sweden that surgery does lead to a longer life , says Bla@@ ck@@ stone , of the University of A@@ ri@@ z@@ ona Col@@ le@@ ge of Medi@@ c@@ ine @-@ P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x .
in the Swedish study , ob@@ ese people who had bar@@ i@@ at@@ ric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years , compared to a group who tried more conventional methods .
though the new study didn &apos;t show a benefit in survival among surgery patients , Bla@@ ck@@ stone said it &apos;s re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a B@@ M@@ I under 35 interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is where this paper is critical , because it says this surgery is safe in that lower B@@ M@@ I group , &quot; with no increased risk of death or ren@@ al disease , she said .
Bla@@ ck@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient &apos;s B@@ M@@ I falls between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this , &quot; she said .
I think that once they &apos;ve ac@@ cum@@ ulated these gen@@ etic changes that hard@@ wi@@ red their bodies into ob@@ es@@ ity and di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes , re@@ vers@@ ing that is really hard .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - D@@ al@@ a@@ i L@@ ama - R@@ T News
Europe could not host all refugees , the D@@ al@@ a@@ i L@@ ama has said , adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East .
the Ti@@ bet@@ an Bu@@ d@@ d@@ h@@ ist leader has called for the ending violence in the refugees &quot; home countries .
the D@@ al@@ a@@ i L@@ ama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the D@@ al@@ a@@ i L@@ ama Centre for comp@@ as@@ sion in O@@ x@@ for@@ d , which is dedicated to eth@@ ics studies , at the beginning of his 10 @-@ day visit to the UK .
he claimed that , under current circumstances , the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of single nations or even contin@@ ents .
he also stressed that , however ad@@ mi@@ ra@@ ble , the West @-@ European countries &quot; response to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation .
&quot; it it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the D@@ al@@ a@@ i L@@ ama praised Germany &apos;s and Austria &apos;s efforts in dealing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; so taking care of several thousand refugees is won@@ der@@ ful , but in the mean time you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , how to bring genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he em@@ ph@@ as@@ ized .
ultimately we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries .
we have to reduce the use of force .
the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added .
addressing the issue of violence , the D@@ al@@ a@@ i L@@ ama also commen@@ ted on George Bush &apos;s actions following 9 / 11 terrorist attacks , claiming that the US &quot; violent response en@@ gen@@ dered a chain of un@@ contr@@ ol@@ la@@ ble events .
after 9 / 11 I expressed my con@@ d@@ ol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and told him the way to solve this problem was through non @-@ violence .
I know his mo@@ tives were good but he used force and it created un@@ expected consequences , &quot; the D@@ al@@ a@@ i L@@ ama said .
fo@@ ur@@ fold increase in children ing@@ es@@ ting hand san@@ iti@@ z@@ er in last 4 years
po@@ is@@ on control cen@@ ters around the United States have reported a nearly 400 @-@ percent up@@ tic@@ k since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 sw@@ allowing highly @-@ al@@ co@@ hol@@ ic hand san@@ iti@@ z@@ er , according to the Georgia po@@ is@@ on Center .
according to Dr@@ . G@@ ay@@ lor@@ d L@@ op@@ e@@ z , director of the Georgia po@@ is@@ on Center , hand san@@ iti@@ z@@ er ing@@ es@@ tion cases in children under 12 that were reported to po@@ is@@ on control cen@@ ters went up from 3,@@ 2@@ 66 in 2010 to 16@@ ,@@ 1@@ 17 in 2014 .
&quot; kids are getting into these products more frequently , and unfortunately , there &apos;s a percentage of them going to the emergency room , &quot; L@@ op@@ e@@ z told CNN .
he said some kids are drinking san@@ iti@@ z@@ er inten@@ tionally , while some do it to im@@ press their friends or on a social @-@ media d@@ are .
vide@@ os on Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be show te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers drinking san@@ iti@@ z@@ er for a cheap bu@@ z@@ z .
te@@ ens have reportedly mixed san@@ iti@@ z@@ er with alcohol @-@ containing m@@ ou@@ th@@ was@@ h for a sti@@ ffer dr@@ ink .
younger children can be drawn to attractive san@@ iti@@ z@@ er sc@@ ents .
&quot; a k@@ id is not thinking this is bad for them , &quot; L@@ op@@ e@@ z said .
a lot of the more attractive ( hand san@@ iti@@ z@@ ers ) are the ones that are s@@ cen@@ ted .
there are stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ry , grap@@ e , or@@ an@@ ge @-@ fla@@ vo@@ red hand san@@ iti@@ z@@ ers that are very appe@@ aling to kids .
hand san@@ iti@@ z@@ er contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
in young children , especially , only a few squ@@ ir@@ ts can cause alcohol po@@ is@@ oning .
&quot; it &apos;s highly con@@ c@@ ent@@ rated alcohol , &quot; Dr@@ . Stephen Th@@ or@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ is@@ on control cen@@ ter at University of Kan@@ sa@@ s Hospital , told Fo@@ x 4 in Kan@@ sa@@ s City .
so you wouldn &apos;t leave a shot of wh@@ is@@ key sitting around , but people will have these hand san@@ iti@@ z@@ ers out and if kids get into it , it &apos;s a quick way to con@@ sum@@ e a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently ing@@ es@@ ted as many as four squ@@ ir@@ ts of stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ry @-@ s@@ cen@@ ted hand san@@ iti@@ z@@ er at school , was taken to an emergency room for treatment .
her blood @-@ alcohol level was .@@ 17@@ 9 , twice the threshold considered legally d@@ run@@ k in an ad@@ ul@@ t , according to Dr@@ . Ch@@ ri@@ s R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency room doctor who treated her at G@@ win@@ n@@ et@@ t Medi@@ cal Center outside of At@@ lan@@ ta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah was sl@@ ur@@ ring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room .
doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children &apos;s hospital for any signs of brain tra@@ um@@ a , as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head , R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; Or@@ tor@@ ia S@@ c@@ ot@@ t , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , told CNN .
it could have been very le@@ th@@ al for my child .
L@@ op@@ e@@ z has recommended parents and teachers use non@@ al@@ co@@ hol@@ ic products or san@@ iti@@ z@@ ing wi@@ p@@ es short of moving hand san@@ iti@@ z@@ er out of a child &apos;s reach .
beyond alcohol po@@ is@@ oning , some san@@ iti@@ z@@ ers have been linked to deaths .
in 2013 , two On@@ tar@@ io women died after sw@@ allowing hand san@@ iti@@ z@@ er that contained a to@@ x@@ ic , un@@ declared ing@@ re@@ di@@ ent .
health officials sur@@ mis@@ ed that the product contained me@@ th@@ an@@ ol , a deadly ag@@ ent , rather than eth@@ y@@ l alcohol , which was listed as the active ing@@ re@@ di@@ ent .
in January , three fourth @-@ grade students in up@@ state New York pl@@ ot@@ ted to po@@ is@@ on their &quot; mean &quot; teacher &quot; by putting anti@@ bac@@ ter@@ ial products around the cl@@ ass@@ room , &quot; according to a police report .
the teacher is highly al@@ ler@@ gic to hand san@@ iti@@ z@@ er and banned it from her room .
police considered the fo@@ iled plan to be &quot; id@@ le ch@@ at@@ ter , &quot; referring discipline to the school district .

drawing attention to the fact that one of the most important features of B@@ A@@ L@@ Ä°@@ S@@ T@@ Ä°@@ K@@ A is its capability to allow three @-@ di@@ men@@ sional data to be obtained and shown which gives more details and less er@@ r@@ ors , I@@ Å@@ Ä±@@ k stresses that bal@@ l@@ isti@@ cs specialists can make decisions more rapidly and their success rate increases thanks to the in@@ nov@@ ations offered by the system .
B@@ A@@ L@@ Ä°@@ S@@ T@@ Ä°@@ K@@ A was exported within the &quot; S@@ U@@ B@@ A @-@ 1 Project &quot;
under@@ lining that B@@ A@@ L@@ Ä°@@ S@@ T@@ Ä°@@ K@@ A meets all the criteria of success and received full marks from the General Directorate of Security , I@@ Å@@ Ä±@@ k noted that all of Turkey is en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ed by the system , established in 10 different regions , with Ankara in first place .
men@@ tioning that the system was opened to foreign markets because of its success , I@@ Å@@ Ä±@@ k said that B@@ A@@ L@@ Ä°@@ S@@ T@@ Ä°@@ K@@ A was exported within the scope of the &quot; S@@ U@@ B@@ A @-@ 1 Project &quot; realised with Saudi Ara@@ bia and its instal@@ lation was completed with success in 6 different regions in 2013 .
I@@ Å@@ Ä±@@ k stated that a new agreement was done for the second bat@@ ch sale of B@@ A@@ L@@ Ä°@@ S@@ T@@ Ä°@@ K@@ A to Saudi Ara@@ bia , and S@@ U@@ B@@ A @-@ 2 was signed as the follow @-@ up of S@@ U@@ B@@ A @-@ 1 , and said that the number of B@@ A@@ L@@ Ä°@@ S@@ T@@ Ä°@@ K@@ A to serve Saudi Ara@@ bia will increase from 6 to 14 with the agreement including the development and instal@@ lation of 8 additional systems .
a bus @-@ sized cro@@ co@@ d@@ ile fos@@ si@@ l was found
it was reported that the sal@@ t water cro@@ co@@ d@@ ile from the pre@@ historic age has a length of approximately 10 metres and we@@ igh@@ ed 3 tonnes .
just the length of the cro@@ co@@ d@@ ile &apos;s s@@ k@@ ul@@ l was meas@@ ured as 1.6 metres .
the researchers named the species &quot; Mac@@ h@@ im@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ us re@@ x &quot; and published their findings in the magazine C@@ re@@ t@@ ac@@ e@@ ous Research .
the lead author of the article , F@@ ed@@ er@@ ic@@ o F@@ anti from B@@ olo@@ gn@@ a University , stated that the fos@@ si@@ l was understood to date from 130 million years ago and &quot; it is nearly the size of a bus . &quot;
speaking to the Washington Post , F@@ anti said that the huge sal@@ t water cro@@ co@@ d@@ ile &quot; was at the top of the food chain at least in a certain region , during that age . &quot;
pal@@ a@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ologists stated that M@@ . re@@ x , believed to be the biggest cro@@ co@@ d@@ ile living in the sea , hun@@ ted in la@@ go@@ ons by lying in wait .
it is thought that the biggest fresh water cro@@ co@@ d@@ ile in history is the &quot; Sar@@ cos@@ u@@ ch@@ us im@@ per@@ ator , &quot; which lived in Africa and South America 110 million years ago and could reach 12 metres in length and 8 tonnes in weight .
all their min@@ ds are very conf@@ used !
the first book from writer E@@ ce T@@ e@@ me@@ l@@ k@@ ur@@ an published in 1996 , &quot; Al@@ l the Women &apos;s Min@@ ds Ar@@ e conf@@ used &quot; was adap@@ ted for theatre with the same name by the Ay@@ sa Pro@@ duction Theatre .
S@@ ele@@ n U@@ Ã§@@ er direc@@ ts the play in which D@@ en@@ iz Ã@@ ak@@ Ä±@@ r , Z@@ ey@@ ne@@ p Kan@@ k@@ on@@ de , Ä°@@ p@@ ek T@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ k@@ tan K@@ ay@@ n@@ ak , K@@ adi@@ r Ã@@ er@@ m@@ ik and Å@@ eb@@ ne@@ m S@@ Ã¶@@ n@@ me@@ z play a part .
U@@ Ã§@@ er , whose plays &quot; Po@@ z &quot; and &quot; Kur@@ u S@@ Ä±@@ k@@ Ä± &quot; are still ongoing , had her first experience of s@@ cri@@ pt writing and direc@@ ting in the play , which questions the conf@@ u@@ sion in women &apos;s min@@ ds .
the play was introduced to an audience in the Tr@@ ump Per@@ for@@ man@@ ce Centre last week .
the play opens with a radio play .
a voice in the dark , taking us back to past years ...
then the cur@@ tain goes up .
a woman , who is sitting on a window le@@ d@@ ge , is on the ver@@ ge of jum@@ ping .
who she is and why she is trying to commit suicide are understood after the intervention of the next @-@ door neighbours .
she left A letter
&quot; E@@ br@@ u U@@ y@@ s@@ al , &quot; played by D@@ en@@ iz Ã@@ ak@@ Ä±@@ r , is a popular writer .
she was left by her husband , but this is not the only reason .
there are some things that have ac@@ cum@@ ulated inside her .
she was brought to this moment because of the fact that she did not enjoy pat@@ er@@ n@@ al love , her ch@@ ild@@ hood was spent in l@@ on@@ el@@ in@@ ess , and the fact that she thinks that she is not understood .
she decided to commit suicide , left a letter behind , but she cannot jump from the window .
because &quot; Ay@@ sel &quot; ( Z@@ ey@@ ne@@ p Kan@@ k@@ on@@ de ) , the pr@@ at@@ t@@ ling , g@@ ul@@ li@@ ble clean@@ er and next @-@ door neighbour , and &quot; Per@@ ran &quot; ( Å@@ eb@@ ne@@ m S@@ Ã¶@@ n@@ me@@ z ) , the my@@ ster@@ ious woman in the op@@ pos@@ ite flat , draw her into conversation .
they approach the situation as if it were a normal , ordinary situation .
the woman becomes more stressed ; she could not con@@ c@@ entr@@ ate and jump .
when the famous singer &quot; M@@ el@@ te@@ m K@@ ay@@ a &quot; ( Ä°@@ p@@ ek T@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ k@@ tan K@@ ay@@ n@@ ak ) , who is having her home clean@@ ed , joins the conversation between the three , the situation turns into a c@@ lam@@ our of voices .
approaching the situation with her n@@ ai@@ ve and s@@ inc@@ ere style , &quot; M@@ el@@ te@@ m &quot; cannot help but sing when she sees a crowd .
this interesting attempt at suicide takes on a different di@@ men@@ sion with the appearance of real estate ag@@ ent &quot; Mur@@ at &quot; ( K@@ adi@@ r Ã@@ er@@ m@@ ik ) with a spar@@ e key .
the situation gets out of hand when the singer &quot; M@@ el@@ te@@ m &quot; gives very in@@ ac@@ cur@@ ate information to the press .
the song &quot; S@@ ok@@ ak K@@ Ä±@@ z@@ Ä± &quot; by N@@ az@@ an Ã@@ n@@ c@@ el is also used in the play .
co@@ medy of de@@ pression
direc@@ ting on the stage for the first time , U@@ Ã§@@ er was successful in ensuring the temp@@ o and flow of the play .
Z@@ ey@@ ne@@ p Kan@@ k@@ on@@ de and Ä°@@ p@@ ek T@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ k@@ tan K@@ ay@@ n@@ ak carry the burden of co@@ medy in the play .
the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated char@@ ac@@ ters played by this du@@ o succeed in making the audience la@@ ug@@ h with both their m@@ im@@ ics and lines .
while Å@@ eb@@ ne@@ m S@@ Ã¶@@ n@@ me@@ z con@@ v@@ ey@@ s her years of experience on the stage very well , D@@ en@@ iz Ã@@ ak@@ Ä±@@ r deli@@ vers a per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve performance in reflecting the de@@ pressed mood of &quot; E@@ br@@ u U@@ y@@ s@@ al . &quot;
making an in@@ deli@@ ble impression with his performance in T@@ ol@@ ga Ã@@ e@@ li@@ k &apos;s award @-@ winning film &quot; Sar@@ ma@@ Å@@ Ä±@@ k , &quot; K@@ adi@@ r Ã@@ er@@ m@@ ik successfully ac@@ companies these four women .
defined as a co@@ medy of de@@ pression , the one @-@ act play promises to make you la@@ ug@@ h without conf@@ using the mind .
here is what st@@ ay@@ ed in my mind from these beautiful words mostly coming from the m@@ ou@@ th of &quot; Per@@ ran , &quot; played by Å@@ eb@@ ne@@ m S@@ Ã¶@@ n@@ me@@ z : do not s@@ cri@@ b@@ ble has@@ ti@@ ly , they will read it ; do not live has@@ ti@@ ly , they will see you .
most children possibly thought of d@@ ying to punish their fa@@ thers and mo@@ thers , and they so@@ me@@ how ended up cr@@ ying at the thought .
the woman is han@@ ging in the air like an un@@ realised j@@ oke .
the woman se@@ ar@@ ches for a fun@@ ny story that she has always forgotten a part of .
in fact , every story begins with a kind of being ab@@ and@@ on@@ ment .
I should put my hands into my poc@@ ket , I cannot stand anything without poc@@ kets .
people do not know where to put their hands .
since we do not know it , our hands multi@@ p@@ ly .
people b@@ ad@@ m@@ ou@@ th what they do not know ; they f@@ ab@@ ri@@ cate and f@@ ab@@ ri@@ cate .
a mis@@ understanding becomes reality .
all the women &apos;s heads are conf@@ used because they are mes@@ sed up by someone .
if you are not able to die , you have a chance to live .
&quot; dr@@ ink ke@@ f@@ ir and live longer &quot;
it can be consu@@ med sa@@ f@@ ely at any age
expressing that one of the n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ents that can be consu@@ med sa@@ f@@ ely by everyone of every age is ke@@ f@@ ir , a mir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ous n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ent which is more beneficial than its main base of milk and whose health benefits are completely un@@ coun@@ table , the speci@@ alist di@@ e@@ ti@@ ci@@ an P@@ Ä±@@ n@@ ar Kur@@ al En@@ Ã§ said that , &quot; It is more n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tious than yo@@ g@@ hurt because it includes pro@@ te@@ in , basic min@@ er@@ als and v@@ it@@ am@@ in B@@ . &quot;
it is rich in v@@ it@@ am@@ in B@@ 1 , B@@ 12 and K@@ .
thanks to its cal@@ ci@@ um and ma@@ gn@@ es@@ ium content , it creates the basis for a healthy ner@@ v@@ ous system .
it is also a good source of ph@@ os@@ ph@@ or@@ ous .
in addition , having the feature of feeling full , ke@@ f@@ ir does not make you gain weight .
she said , &quot; its n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tional value is high and it is a di@@ ges@@ ti@@ ble dr@@ ink . &quot;
c@@ ure @-@ all
explaining that children , the elderly , expec@@ tan@@ t mo@@ thers and women entering the period of men@@ op@@ a@@ use can con@@ sum@@ e ke@@ f@@ ir without hes@@ itation , the speci@@ alist di@@ e@@ ti@@ ci@@ an P@@ Ä±@@ n@@ ar Kur@@ al En@@ Ã§ said , &quot; K@@ ef@@ ir is originally a local dr@@ ink made in the Caucasus . &quot;
however it started to become famous around the world .
being the secret of y@@ ou@@ th@@ f@@ ul@@ ness and an eli@@ x@@ ir for a long an healthy life , ke@@ f@@ ir c@@ ures nearly all conditions .
K@@ ef@@ ir is one of the most natural ways to protect ba@@ bi@@ es from Met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ic ill@@ n@@ esses .
In@@ te@@ st@@ ine @-@ friendly
this unique be@@ ver@@ age , containing coun@@ t@@ less benefits , is in@@ te@@ st@@ ine @-@ friendly .
there are around 1.5 @-@ 2 kil@@ os of bac@@ ter@@ ia and fun@@ gu@@ s in our in@@ te@@ st@@ ines .
m@@ ic@@ ro @-@ or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ms in the di@@ ges@@ tive system are divided into two groups : beneficial and de@@ tri@@ mental ones .
beneficial m@@ ic@@ ro @-@ or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ms are called &quot; pro@@ bi@@ otic m@@ ic@@ ro @-@ or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ms . &quot;
the activities of pro@@ bio@@ tics have an important effect as much as our li@@ ver , and if they are consu@@ med sufficiently they prevent de@@ tri@@ mental m@@ ic@@ ro @-@ or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ms in the in@@ te@@ st@@ ines from sti@@ c@@ king and spreading to the in@@ te@@ st@@ in@@ al wall .
I@@ mp@@ air@@ ment of the balance of healthy m@@ ic@@ ro @-@ or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ms in the in@@ te@@ st@@ ine causes disease .
the health of the di@@ ges@@ tive tr@@ act should be protected through proper no@@ ur@@ is@@ hment .
to do this , we should certainly con@@ sum@@ e a sufficient amount of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
it res@@ ol@@ ves all these problems found in the in@@ te@@ st@@ ine
K@@ ef@@ ir is the most effective pro@@ bi@@ otic inc@@ lu@@ sive n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ent and the beneficial bac@@ ter@@ ia inside of it has a great effect in the strengthening of the in@@ te@@ st@@ in@@ al system .
it en@@ ab@@ les the good bac@@ ter@@ ia and fun@@ gu@@ s in the in@@ te@@ st@@ ines to re@@ produce he@@ al@@ th@@ ily and to benefit us .
with regular use of ke@@ f@@ ir , the in@@ te@@ st@@ ines will function , in@@ te@@ st@@ in@@ al dis@@ orders will be resolved , blo@@ ating will be reduced , and he@@ al@@ th@@ ier di@@ ges@@ tion will be obtained .
a healthy di@@ ges@@ tive system means a healthy and disease @-@ free body .
she said , &quot; K@@ ef@@ ir also c@@ ures loss of appe@@ ti@@ te , In@@ s@@ om@@ n@@ ia , up@@ per res@@ p@@ ir@@ atory tr@@ act inf@@ ec@@ tions and al@@ ler@@ gies , and will help ba@@ bi@@ es to absor@@ b v@@ it@@ am@@ ins and min@@ er@@ als from fo@@ ods more e@@ ff@@ ic@@ i@@ ently , so it under@@ takes an important role in the n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion of ba@@ bi@@ es . &quot;

having conce@@ ded 36 goals in a 17 week @-@ period , Mer@@ s@@ in Ä°@@ d@@ man@@ y@@ ur@@ d@@ u is one of two teams who conce@@ de most in the le@@ ag@@ ue alongside Es@@ k@@ i@@ Å@@ e@@ h@@ ir@@ sp@@ or , sharing last place on the rankings table .

Putin e@@ ats his words
while Russia is preparing to recognise the status of &quot; able to do business with Russia &quot; for Turkish companies if it cannot replace the services offered by Turkey , the head of the Russian T@@ our Oper@@ ators Union stated , &quot; Russian citizens do not give up on Turkey . &quot;
calc@@ ulating that cutting current economic ties with Turkey will bring additional costs to Russia , the Ministry of Economic Development for Russia prepared a new &quot; ex@@ cep@@ tional cases &quot; bill for the Russian Government regarding Turkey .
according to the proposal , published in the Russian Federal Re@@ gu@@ la@@ tion , giving permission to Turkish companies and firms is allowed when it becomes necessary even in the area of sanctions .
according to the proposal , goods and services from Turkish companies and firms will be used in cases where it is impossible to provide them from sources other than Turkey and domestic production in Russia brings serious additional costs .
the committee formed within the Ministry of Economic Development for Russia with other related ministries will determine which services and goods of Turkish origin will be included in this category .
therefore , officials will selec@@ t and decide which Turkish companies will be able to work with Russia .
moreover , according to this document , state organiz@@ ations and private companies in Russia will have to prove that there is no Russian equivalent for the business they will do with Turkish partners .
in the case that the proposal is approved by the Russian government and takes effect , the pre@@ fer@@ red Turkish companies will be registered in Russia .
the Russian T@@ our Oper@@ ators Union expressed that Russian citizens have not given up on Turkey in the ex@@ plan@@ ation it made y@@ es@@ ter@@ day .
the ex@@ plan@@ ation includes the following : &quot; in spite of the ban on the sale of tour@@ s and the advice of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia to not go to Turkey , our citizens have started to search for ways to or@@ g@@ an@@ ize their holiday by themselves . &quot;
the number of the posts titled &quot; the most practical and the che@@ ap@@ est way to take a holiday in Turkey &quot; keeps s@@ no@@ w@@ bal@@ ling in social media on the internet .
the most widespread advice is to make online hotel res@@ er@@ v@@ ations and to fly with Turkish Airlines .
the Russian Prime Minister D@@ mit@@ ry Medvedev defined the oil price falling under 30 dollars as a &quot; dra@@ ma@@ tical development &quot; from Russia &apos;s vi@@ e@@ w@@ point .
Medvedev said , &quot; No@@ body thought that p@@ et@@ ro@@ le@@ um would fall under 30 dollars and it was also a big surprise for our government . &quot;
he said , &quot; A@@ t this rate , it seems impossible to implement the budget as is now . &quot;
we passed the last month of 2015 .
after the shot @-@ down plane crisis , Russian President Putin an@@ no@@ un@@ ces that economic sanctions will be intensified .
in those days , our businessmen and our Turkish Airlines staff suffered a lot , trying to go to Russia in the usual way .
obstacles are set for Turkish goods at customs , and they are sub@@ j@@ ected to un@@ th@@ in@@ k@@ ab@@ le checks .
1 month , not much , passes from then ti@@ ll now , and N@@ er@@ du@@ n H@@ ac@@ Ä±@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u reports from Moscow y@@ es@@ ter@@ day .
one way or another , sanctions are being e@@ ased one by one .
all right , but why ?
the reason is simple .
it is because the closing of border crossings with the methods of a century ago and efforts to con@@ ver@@ t a political fight into an economic fight are no longer effective in an era when the economy has become so g@@ lob@@ alised .
look , we are continuing to write news about how the economic embargo implemented against Iran for many years was fl@@ ou@@ ted .
Russia and Turkey are countries that seem to have many allies but actually don &apos;t have so many , and they are dependent upon each other .
it is not technically possible to separate the two countries in one night , connected through their businessmen , tourists , entrepreneurs and customers .
if you close the doors , the people of these two countries will enter each other &apos;s countries from the ch@@ im@@ ne@@ y .
the most correct way is to have political discussion and to make terms at the table before the sanctions create new Re@@ za Z@@ ar@@ ra@@ bs ( R@@ Ä±@@ z@@ a Sar@@ ra@@ f ) .
without involving the economics ...
hotel attack in Bur@@ k@@ ina F@@ as@@ o : 20 killed
it has been reported that at least 20 people were killed in the attack carried out with an explosives @-@ la@@ den vehicle on the Ho@@ tel Sp@@ len@@ did in Bur@@ k@@ ina F@@ as@@ o &apos;s capital O@@ u@@ ag@@ ad@@ ou@@ go@@ u .
officials from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Bur@@ k@@ ina F@@ as@@ o stated that security forces have found 20 cor@@ p@@ ses , some of which were in the lob@@ by of the hotel and others were found in the hotel caf@@ Ã© .
it was reported that 63 hos@@ t@@ ages , including the Minister of Labour for Bur@@ k@@ ina F@@ as@@ o , were res@@ cu@@ ed in the operation organiz@@ ed by the security forces and supported by French special forces ; 33 of which were injured .
it is not known how many hos@@ t@@ ages and at@@ t@@ ack@@ ers are in the 14@@ 7 @-@ room hotel .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses said that two explosives @-@ la@@ den vehicles exploded just outside the Ho@@ tel Sp@@ len@@ did , pre@@ fer@@ red mostly by United N@@ ations personnel and foreigners , and 3 @-@ 4 mas@@ ked people entered the hotel .
up@@ setting news from S@@ ur : 1 m@@ art@@ y@@ r
severely wounded by the explosion from a hand @-@ made explosive set by terrorists y@@ es@@ ter@@ day in the S@@ ur district , in which the cur@@ few is in its 4@@ 6th day , and taken to the D@@ i@@ y@@ ar@@ bak@@ Ä±@@ r Military Hospital , police officer Ali Bul@@ du@@ k could not be sa@@ v@@ ed and died a m@@ art@@ y@@ r in spite of interven@@ tions .
it is understood that the m@@ art@@ y@@ r was registered in the civil registry of Ad@@ ana .
residents of D@@ i@@ y@@ ar@@ bak@@ Ä±@@ r did not support the terrorist protest !
according to the information obtained , a &quot; raise your voice &quot; protest against the operations was planned at 17 : 0@@ 0 in the evening in front of the A@@ Z@@ C Pla@@ za in Ek@@ inc@@ il@@ er Street , in the O@@ f@@ is neighbourhood , Y@@ en@@ i@@ Å@@ e@@ hi@@ r district , D@@ i@@ y@@ ar@@ bak@@ Ä±@@ r .
people did not participate in the protest in the desi@@ red numbers , to which residents were invited through bro@@ ch@@ ures and appeals .
what drew most attention was that the citizens did not support the recent protests , whereas thousands of people participated in the previously organiz@@ ed protests .
not having the expected support in front of the A@@ Z@@ C Pla@@ za , the group dis@@ solved without protesting because they were not supported by the D@@ i@@ y@@ ar@@ bak@@ Ä±@@ r residents .
terrorists burned a school in D@@ i@@ y@@ ar@@ bak@@ Ä±@@ r
according to the information obtained , the incident oc@@ cu@@ red on 10@@ 0@@ 7th street of the Y@@ un@@ us Em@@ re neighbourhood in the central B@@ a@@ Ä@@ lar district .
entering the N@@ ur@@ i Z@@ ek@@ i@@ y@@ e H@@ as Sec@@ on@@ d@@ ary School at around 19 : 30 , a group of terrorists with mas@@ ked faces threw Mol@@ ot@@ ov co@@ ck@@ ta@@ ils , set the building al@@ ight and fled .
when the building bur@@ st into fla@@ mes , the people in the surrounding area noti@@ fied the fire department .
the fire department called the police and asked them to take safety prec@@ au@@ tions before entering the area .
in response to this , many police were dis@@ pat@@ ched to the area with ar@@ m@@ oured vehicles .
once security measures had been taken , the fire teams ex@@ tin@@ gu@@ ished the fire before it eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ed the entire building .
after that the police carried out crime scene investigations and a multi@@ fac@@ e@@ ted operation was launched to arrest the es@@ cap@@ ing terrorists .
meanwhile , some police officers at the scene of the incident helped journalists to take photos , but one officer tried to prevent the journalists from taking photos .
the AT@@ M rob@@ bers were captured
police squ@@ ads from the Ä°@@ z@@ mir Police Department started an operation after complaints that some people &apos;s bank cards were stolen and cash was withdrawn and money was spent from their accounts .
determining within the scope of the investigation that the perpetrators of the incident were M@@ .@@ M@@ .@@ G ( 43 ) and R@@ .@@ O ( 32 ) , the police discovered that the suspects cop@@ ied people &apos;s card information with the help of a &quot; card cop@@ ying mechanism &quot; and a &quot; m@@ ini cam@@ era &quot; they placed on AT@@ M@@ s in different prov@@ inc@@ es of Turkey .
it has been discovered that the suspects , after learning the card p@@ ass@@ words , then made transactions with these cards .
the suspects were taken into custody at the end of the operation .
exam@@ ining the lap@@ top computer used by M@@ .@@ M@@ .@@ G@@ . and R@@ .@@ O , the squ@@ ads rec@@ over@@ ed many video records from the m@@ ini cam@@ era mechanism set to obtain the p@@ ass@@ words of people making transactions in AT@@ M@@ s ; and they determined that the suspects st@@ ay@@ ed only for a short time in each province they visited in order to avoid arrest .
it was also revealed that the suspects made 50 thousand li@@ ra in illegal profits with the cop@@ ying operation which they used in 15 different AT@@ M@@ s in Ä°@@ z@@ mir .
the suspects were pro@@ ces@@ sed in the Police station , and then brought to court where they were detained in custody .
officials warned people against this kind of activity and to check their accounts regularly and to s@@ cre@@ en with their hands when entering p@@ ass@@ words at AT@@ M@@ s .
the Netherlands : Assad should be tried in the Hague
the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands , Ber@@ t Ko@@ en@@ ders , stated that the Syrian President Bas@@ ha@@ r al @-@ Assad should be tried in the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) in the Hague .
making a speech in a conference he participated in at the Hague , Ko@@ en@@ ders stated that Assad is responsible for the refugee influx .
indi@@ c@@ ating that it is not possible to bring peace to Syria as long as Assad is in power , Ko@@ en@@ ders stated the following :
Assad should be tried in the ICC in the Hague .
someone with so many people &apos;s blood on his hands should be held accountable before the court .
in addition to this , Assad is solely responsible for the refugee influx we are now facing .
however , I am aware of the fact that Assad will not leave his post in the near future .
this matter should be talked about first and there is a need for Russia &apos;s help within this context .

A@@ dam Ro@@ on@@ ey &apos;s first @-@ half penalty gave A@@ ber@@ de@@ en a narrow victory over Ham@@ il@@ ton at P@@ it@@ to@@ dri@@ e , allowing the D@@ ons to open up a five @-@ point gap between themselves and C@@ el@@ tic .
G@@ ri@@ ff@@ i@@ ths plays down dis@@ har@@ mon@@ y talk
it has sparked rumours of dis@@ har@@ mon@@ y at C@@ el@@ tic , which was dismissed out of hand by G@@ ri@@ ff@@ i@@ ths , who insisted he and his team @-@ ma@@ tes are not la@@ bour@@ ing under any sense of increased scrutiny as they prepare to face the Dutch League leaders .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
lack of S@@ c@@ ots title race bo@@ res Dutch - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ an@@ gers mid@@ fi@@ el@@ der and ex @-@ Netherlands international R@@ on@@ ald de Bo@@ er has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in C@@ el@@ tic - because there &apos;s no title ri@@ val@@ ry with R@@ an@@ gers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ a@@ x , said : &quot; in Hol@@ land , they don &apos;t show highlights of the C@@ el@@ tic games any more and why ? &quot;
it is because R@@ an@@ gers ar@@ en &apos;t there .
people here don &apos;t only talk about R@@ an@@ gers coming back .
they talk about the Old F@@ ir@@ m .
they talk about both teams together and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old F@@ ir@@ m games and it is not just people in S@@ c@@ ot@@ land who want to see those games .
I &apos;ll turn things around , vo@@ ws De@@ il@@ a
RO@@ N@@ N@@ Y De@@ il@@ a has accepted C@@ el@@ tic are struggling , but the Norwegian bos@@ s vowed to turn things around .
defeat to Mal@@ mo and subsequent Cha@@ mp@@ ions League exit was s@@ wi@@ f@@ tly followed by losing to 10 @-@ man A@@ ber@@ de@@ en , who now sit five points clear at the top of the table .
but De@@ il@@ a said : &quot; C@@ el@@ tic have had bad periods before and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out of it as quickly as possible .
I know it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sa@@ d about what is happening .
that is the same as we are - but we have to go on .
we really , really need the support of C@@ el@@ tic because that makes the players much better .
to stay together now is so important .
W@@ ar@@ bur@@ ton w@@ ary of January trans@@ f@@ ers
despite comments just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he had identified some January transfer targets , R@@ an@@ gers bos@@ s Mark W@@ ar@@ bur@@ ton is w@@ ary of a signing sp@@ ree , insisting he doesn &apos;t want to dis@@ rupt the I@@ bro@@ x squ@@ ad &apos;s unity .
the ex @-@ Br@@ ent@@ for@@ d g@@ aff@@ er said : &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
in terms of players coming in the summer , you have that pre @-@ season period to bed them in , which you &apos;ve seen with our own group this season .
the squ@@ ad is doing really well .
sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
C@@ el@@ tic target Mic@@ hu in retirement hin@@ t
S@@ w@@ an@@ sea stri@@ ker Mic@@ hu , linked with C@@ el@@ tic during the transfer window , has dropped hin@@ ts that he could re@@ tir@@ e when his contract with the sw@@ ans is up .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a troub@@ le@@ some an@@ k@@ le for two years , and failed to find a move away from W@@ al@@ es in the summer .

S@@ c@@ ots unemployment remains unchanged as UK total ris@@ es
unemployment in S@@ c@@ ot@@ land remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 during the period May to July while the number out of work for the UK as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million during the same period .
S@@ c@@ ot@@ land &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 per cent was above the UK &apos;s rate of 5.5 per cent , the Office for National Statistics ( ons ) figures showed .
meanwhile , employment in S@@ c@@ ot@@ land fell by 12,000 during the three month period , with the number of those in work now standing at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for S@@ c@@ ot@@ land fell over the quarter at 7@@ 4.@@ 0 per cent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 per cent .
Secretary of State for S@@ c@@ ot@@ land David Mun@@ de@@ ll , commenting on the latest figures , said : &quot; the government &apos;s long term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year since S@@ c@@ ot@@ land made the historic decision to remain part of the UK .

why I &apos;m A W@@ it@@ ness A@@ t A@@ n Ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tion In Ok@@ la@@ h@@ om@@ a
later today , bar@@ ring a late legal intervention , I will watch a man being put to death .
if it happens , and I hope it won &apos;t , I will sit in a viewing gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ h@@ om@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary as Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ th@@ al in@@ j@@ ec@@ tion .
he has asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was first made back in January , via his best friend , and though I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day approaches , I &apos;ve come to dre@@ ad it .
so why do it ?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
true , journalists are per@@ mit@@ ted to watch ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tions in America and because there are often more applications than seats available , a ma@@ cab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place to decide who will be chosen .
Ok@@ la@@ h@@ om@@ a has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five .
who@@ ever is pic@@ ked will watch it dis@@ pas@@ sion@@ ately .
I cannot do that .
I will be sitting alongside Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p &apos;s clos@@ est friends , and I have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls , and one visit lasting two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours .
I like the gu@@ y .
we often la@@ ug@@ h a lot when we talk .
the prison authorities say I cannot be both a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed a no@@ te@@ book and p@@ en to record what I see .
I will just have to try to remember all the details .
one Ok@@ la@@ h@@ om@@ a journalist accused me on T@@ w@@ it@@ ter of com@@ promising my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here &apos;s the les@@ son .
tell the in@@ mate &apos;s story the way he lik@@ es it , get access .
I complained to her .
she admitted that she &quot; could have ph@@ r@@ ased it better , &quot; but still thinks I &apos;m wrong to do what I &apos;m doing .
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p has taken issue with some of the things I &apos;ve said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he did .
I &apos;ve told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter to be there to write about it .
if he di@@ es , he thinks the public@@ ity will help the anti @-@ death penalty movement .
K@@ im Bel@@ l@@ w@@ are , a reporter from the H@@ u@@ ff@@ ing@@ ton Post , will be alongside me .
if you want to know more about the case , ple@@ ase listen to the series of po@@ d@@ cas@@ ts I &apos;ve made .
I won &apos;t go over all the details again here .
I cannot say with cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Bar@@ ry Van T@@ re@@ ese would make him guilty of being an ac@@ ces@@ sor@@ y after the fact .
but I believe there is a strong pro@@ b@@ ability that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justi@@ fy a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and it &apos;s from this perspective that I will watch him die .
I cannot claim to be truly objective .
there will be other reporters you can turn to for that .
what you will get from me is what it &apos;s like to watch a man I like die an unnecessary death .

Peter Moody alle@@ ges ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ y on him and threatens to quit rac@@ ing
Peter Moody has alleged R@@ ac@@ ing Vic@@ tor@@ ia ste@@ wards attempted to plant a sp@@ y in his st@@ ab@@ les last year and threatened to quit rac@@ ing immediately .
he took aim at ste@@ wards and R@@ ac@@ ing Vic@@ tor@@ ia &apos;s integrity department , al@@ leg@@ ing they have a personal campaign against him with the late scr@@ at@@ ching of L@@ ad@@ y Tat@@ a@@ i because of a race day treatment the final stra@@ w on Wednesday .
Moody told F@@ air@@ fa@@ x Media he had always tried to do what is best for rac@@ ing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to L@@ id@@ ari &apos;s positive s@@ wa@@ b to co@@ bal@@ t , which he can not explain .
he had bi@@ t@@ ten his ton@@ gue about the sp@@ y allegations for 18 months and didn &apos;t want it &quot; to look like s@@ our grap@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I wasn &apos;t going to say anything about that and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so fru@@ stra@@ ted it all comes out at once , &quot; Moody said .
they know it went on .
sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said .
I will go home ton@@ ight and sle@@ ep well .
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
when they start to think I &apos;m not that &apos;s when I shouldn &apos;t be a tra@@ in@@ er .
I would then have to consider what I do with my lic@@ ence .
earlier , Moody had dropped the b@@ om@@ b@@ shel@@ l in a rac@@ ing@@ .com interview that the integrity department had tried to sp@@ y on his stable .
&quot; E@@ igh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , D@@ ay@@ le Bro@@ wn and Dr Bri@@ an Ste@@ war@@ t sat in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my st@@ ab@@ les to offer information on what I was doing within my st@@ ab@@ les , &quot; Moody said on R@@ ac@@ ing@@ .@@ com@@ .
they obviously believe I &apos;m a che@@ at .
if that &apos;s the case su@@ rely they should all hand in their bri@@ ef@@ s because they &apos;ve been in@@ competent in trying to catch me .
Robert Ro@@ ul@@ st@@ on , former chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ o@@ o@@ die , current chairman of R@@ V@@ L , and Bernard Sa@@ un@@ d@@ ry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of that at the time and are aware of that today .
should that make me think it &apos;s becoming personal ?
has R@@ V@@ L got a grow a set of bal@@ ls and maybe make people outside of tra@@ in@@ ers responsible for what it is going on the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I that bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there think I am .
maybe they need to take my lic@@ ence off me and push me away and I &apos;ve got no doubt what I &apos;m saying now might make them think about that .
but I &apos;ve got to the point now where I don &apos;t care and that sa@@ d@@ den@@ s me .
that really sa@@ d@@ den@@ s me .
I will put the pressure on them and on@@ us on them to make a decision .

M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne Storm coach C@@ ra@@ i@@ g Bel@@ lam@@ y hits back at rivals over wrestling claims
M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne Storm coach C@@ ra@@ i@@ g Bel@@ lam@@ y has called criticism of his side &apos;s tackling as &quot; agenda setting &quot; by the N@@ RL &apos;s two premi@@ er@@ ship favour@@ ites .
Sydney Ro@@ os@@ ters coach Tr@@ ent R@@ ob@@ in@@ son said the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm to &quot; w@@ rest@@ le &quot; his side during the Storm &apos;s up@@ set win in the qu@@ al@@ ifying final in Sydney on Friday night .
Br@@ is@@ ban@@ e Br@@ on@@ co@@ s coach W@@ ay@@ ne Ben@@ n@@ et@@ t made a th@@ in@@ ly ve@@ iled reference to the Storm after his side &apos;s qu@@ al@@ ifying final win over North Qu@@ e@@ en@@ s@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys on Saturday night when he called that game a &quot; show@@ case &quot; of the ru@@ g@@ by le@@ ag@@ ue and said the two Qu@@ e@@ en@@ s@@ land w@@ er@@ en &apos;t &quot; too big &quot; into wrestling .
Bel@@ lam@@ y defended his side &apos;s tackling and said they just focused on their &quot; contact &quot; when tackling .
Bel@@ lam@@ y added he took confidence from having two leading co@@ ach@@ es critic@@ ise his side as it meant they were concerned about the Storm beating them .
&quot; that keeps coming up - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent R@@ ob@@ in@@ son bring up wrestling when they beat us 24 @-@ 2 , &quot; Bel@@ lam@@ y said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee we haven &apos;t changed nothing all year with our defen@@ sive systems or te@@ ch@@ ni@@ ques , it &apos;s just that the last six weeks we have made a real emphasis with our contact in t@@ ack@@ les and that has been the turn around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him .
it &apos;s fun@@ ny how this always comes up at this time of year .
Bel@@ lam@@ y challenged Ben@@ n@@ et@@ t &apos;s idea of &quot; ex@@ citing football &quot; remin@@ ding his men@@ tor that Ben@@ n@@ et@@ t &apos;s St George @-@ Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra dra@@ g@@ ons won the premi@@ er@@ ship in 2010 by playing &quot; bor@@ ing &quot; football .
W@@ ay@@ ne is talking about ex@@ citing foot@@ y .
he made a point of compar@@ ing his game on Saturday night with our one on Friday night and how ex@@ citing their game was , &quot; Bel@@ lam@@ y said .
I remember in 2010 St George was criticised a lot for being a bor@@ ing team and W@@ ay@@ ne said he didn &apos;t give a r@@ at &apos;s ar@@ se .
but now he has a team which can play what we would see as ex@@ citing foot@@ y , especially his young hal@@ ves with their speed .
that &apos;s the foot@@ y you would want to play when you have those sort of players .
he made that point in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his style of foot@@ y - not every team has two hal@@ ves like An@@ th@@ ony Mil@@ for@@ d and B@@ en H@@ un@@ t so they can play like that .
to me it bu@@ il@@ ds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us .
six weeks ago they probably w@@ er@@ en &apos;t thinking of us when they get to the big games .
Bel@@ lam@@ y also pointed out the Storm and Ro@@ os@@ ters game was a higher scoring contest than the Br@@ on@@ co@@ s and C@@ ow@@ boys game .
the Br@@ on@@ co@@ s game was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t watched it yet but what was the score ? 16 @-@ 12 ?
our game it was 20 @-@ 18 , there was two more tries in our game but is that ex@@ citing foot@@ y ?
or is it making breaks and not scoring tries that is ex@@ citing ?
to me it &apos;s ag@@ en@@ das .
if they are men@@ tioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there .
the Storm have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Qu@@ e@@ en@@ s@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys or C@@ r@@ on@@ ul@@ la S@@ har@@ ks in next Saturday night &apos;s preliminary final at A@@ A@@ M@@ I Park with tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning .
Serbian man gets $ 200@@ k ba@@ il on drug charge
a man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to pos@@ s@@ ess 40 kil@@ o@@ gra@@ ms of cocaine that was s@@ m@@ ug@@ g@@ led into Qu@@ e@@ en@@ s@@ land has been granted ba@@ il on a $ 200,000 su@@ re@@ ty .
Marko Mak@@ sim@@ ovic , 29 , was one of five men arrested last month after federal police trac@@ ked 100 kil@@ o@@ gra@@ ms of the drug from the y@@ ac@@ h@@ t S@@ ola@@ y , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and do@@ c@@ ked at Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ sim@@ ovic was observed meeting with his co @-@ accused at the mar@@ ina throughout the morning and later met them at the Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ ad@@ house caf@@ e , where police found 40 kil@@ o@@ gra@@ ms of the drug in a T@@ oy@@ ot@@ a Echo .
despite facing a potential life sentence for attempting to pos@@ s@@ ess a commercial qu@@ anti@@ ty of cocaine , Mak@@ sim@@ ovic &apos;s lawyer argued there was no evidence that he was attempting to pos@@ s@@ ess all of it and that he might have been at the caf@@ e for an innocent purpose .
Supreme Court Judge Peter F@@ lan@@ ag@@ an was concerned Mak@@ sim@@ ovic was a flight risk .
he has clear connections to Serbia .
he trav@@ els to Serbia often , &quot; he told the court on Wednesday .
on the cro@@ wn case he lied to police about where he was staying .
Mak@@ sim@@ ovic &apos;s mother and ste@@ p@@ father had jointly offered a su@@ re@@ ty of $ 200,000 to secure his release .
&quot; having read the af@@ fi@@ da@@ v@@ its of both those persons , it is clear that the im@@ position of a su@@ re@@ ty of $ 200,000 constitu@@ tes a real financial burden on them , &quot; Judge F@@ lan@@ ag@@ an said .
but that alone was insufficient to de@@ ter him from failing to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ sim@@ ovic was granted ba@@ il on the conditions that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports , report to police on a daily basis and ad@@ her@@ es to a 6@@ pm @-@ 6@@ am cur@@ few .
Ste@@ van Ho@@ g@@ g used girls phone to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send images
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ h@@ ile used an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl &apos;s phone to sol@@ ic@@ it child abuse images .
Ste@@ van Ho@@ g@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone as she sle@@ pt then lo@@ g@@ ged into an online mes@@ sa@@ ging service where he had a suc@@ ces@@ sion of in@@ dec@@ ent images of children sent to him by another us@@ er .
the girl later w@@ oke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sle@@ eping Ho@@ g@@ g &apos;s hand .
she looked through it and found the distur@@ bing messages before immediately al@@ er@@ ting her mother .
police attended and saw the five pictures , then analy@@ sed computers found at the address and discovered &quot; concerning &quot; web se@@ ar@@ ches using terms for finding in@@ dec@@ ent image of children .
Ho@@ g@@ g then claimed to officers he had done it as it would &quot; lead pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es &quot; on the internet before &quot; pre@@ ten@@ ding he was a police officer to sc@@ are them . &quot;
fiscal de@@ p@@ ute E@@ il@@ id@@ h Robertson told D@@ un@@ de@@ e S@@ her@@ if@@ f Court : &quot; he said it was an addi@@ ction - that he was addi@@ c@@ ted to scar@@ ing people .
he accepted the se@@ ar@@ ches were made by him on the computer but said it was because he wanted to pre@@ tend to be a police officer to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked about his con@@ vers@@ ations with the unknown person who sent him the images and him asking them to send more photos .
he said he was doing it to l@@ ure them in .
he said he was si@@ ck in the head when he was drinking and said he wants to view rap@@ e and murder images .
M@@ s Robertson added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone she sh@@ ou@@ ted her mother and was s@@ h@@ ak@@ ing and cr@@ ying .
she saw the in@@ dec@@ ent images on the phone and the accused was then confron@@ ted .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and spoke of the accused using the computer and P@@ lay@@ St@@ ation to talk to girls who looked way younger than him .
Ho@@ g@@ g , 23 , of W@@ ard Ro@@ ad , D@@ un@@ de@@ e , pleaded guilty on indictment to charges of taking or making in@@ dec@@ ent images of children on June 14 last year , b@@ reaching ba@@ il on January 25 this year and failing to attend at court for a hearing on March 24 this year .
defence sol@@ ic@@ it@@ or Gre@@ g@@ or SI@@ M asked that Ho@@ g@@ g not be placed on the sex offen@@ ders register as it may be argued there was &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; to his crime .
S@@ her@@ if@@ f Al@@ ist@@ air Car@@ m@@ ic@@ ha@@ el de@@ fer@@ red sentence until October for social work background reports .
Ho@@ g@@ g was granted ba@@ il in this case but was held in custody ahead of he@@ ar@@ ings on other outstanding cases .
he was placed on the sex offen@@ ders register ahead of his sen@@ ten@@ cing date .
Z@@ im@@ b@@ ab@@ we &apos;s Robert M@@ ug@@ ab@@ e deli@@ vers wrong speech in parliament
M@@ r M@@ ug@@ ab@@ e , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , earlier this year fell down the steps leading from a po@@ di@@ um .
he was un@@ hurt , but video of the fall went v@@ ir@@ al on social media .
the opening of parliament was also tar@@ n@@ ished by claims by opposition leg@@ is@@ la@@ tors that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against bo@@ o@@ ing M@@ r M@@ ug@@ ab@@ e during his address .
last month , they bo@@ o@@ ed and h@@ ec@@ k@@ led him during his state of the nation address in parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
movement for Democratic C@@ han@@ ge ( M@@ D@@ C ) chief wh@@ ip In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to dis@@ rupt N@@ r M@@ ug@@ ab@@ e &apos;s address .
&quot; the message is coming from a number which is not reflecting but it &apos;s titled &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he told journalists after M@@ r M@@ ug@@ ab@@ e &apos;s speech .
it warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends at parliament and once they step out of parliament that parliamentary immunity does not operate .
the chief wh@@ ip said the party , led by M@@ organ T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , is &quot; worried &quot; about the threats to its politicians .
He@@ w@@ let@@ t @-@ P@@ ac@@ kar@@ d to cut up to 30,000 jobs
He@@ w@@ let@@ t @-@ P@@ ac@@ kar@@ d expects to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost @-@ sa@@ v@@ ing efforts at it enterprise services business .
H@@ P is sp@@ lit@@ ting into two listed companies later this year , separ@@ ating its computer and pr@@ in@@ ter businesses from its faster @-@ growing corporate hard@@ w@@ are and services operations .
the expected job cuts will result in a charge of about $ 2.@@ 7@@ b@@ n , beginning in the fourth quarter , H@@ P said in a statement .
&quot; these restructuring activities will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ let@@ t P@@ ac@@ kar@@ d Enter@@ prise , &quot; said Me@@ g W@@ hit@@ man , the H@@ P chairman and chief executive who will head the unit after the split .
&quot; He@@ w@@ let@@ t P@@ ac@@ kar@@ d Enter@@ prise will be smaller and more focused than H@@ P is today , and we will have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help enterprises transition to the new style of business , &quot; said W@@ hit@@ man .
as a separate company , we are better positi@@ oned than ever to meet the evol@@ ving needs of our customers around the world .
He@@ w@@ let@@ t P@@ ac@@ kar@@ d Enter@@ prise will have more than $ 50@@ b@@ n in annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on deli@@ ver@@ ing un@@ ri@@ val@@ ed integrated technology solutions &quot; to companies , according to a company statement .
it breaks up a company formed in the 19@@ 30@@ s by Stan@@ for@@ d University gra@@ du@@ ates Bill He@@ w@@ let@@ t and D@@ ave P@@ ac@@ kar@@ d to make electric equipment , and whose Pal@@ o Al@@ to gar@@ age has been dubbed &quot; the bi@@ r@@ th@@ place of Sil@@ ic@@ on Valley . &quot;
H@@ P has been undergoing a massive re@@ organisation to cope with the move away from traditional personal computers to mobile devices .
the move by H@@ P , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC maker and one of the biggest US te@@ ch firms , is the latest in the sector based on the belief that tigh@@ tly focused firms perform better .
ar@@ sen@@ al cap@@ tain Mi@@ ke@@ l Ar@@ te@@ ta says team @-@ ma@@ tes must get behind injured J@@ ack W@@ il@@ sh@@ ere ahead of Din@@ am@@ o Zagreb ti@@ e
W@@ en@@ ger has also stressed to W@@ il@@ sh@@ ere that it is still only September and , providing his rehabilitation goes to plan , there is no reason why he cannot be back playing by Christmas .
that best @-@ case scenario already means that W@@ il@@ sh@@ ere is certain to mis@@ s at least the next four England games and , given his history , his involvement in next summer &apos;s European Championship is clearly uncertain .
the great sha@@ me of this latest problem is that W@@ il@@ sh@@ ere had finished last season strongly after a separate an@@ k@@ le in@@ j@@ ur@@ y and then looked back to his old s@@ har@@ p@@ ness during pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of in@@ j@@ ur@@ y is not career @-@ threatening , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger .
it is a bone that did not he@@ al well .
it is nothing major .
this was just an accident .
it was not linked with his an@@ k@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
that might be true from a pu@@ rely medical perspective but , as W@@ en@@ ger also acknowledged , there is the related danger of further injuries wh@@ en@@ ever any player tries to return mid@@ season .
there is also an un@@ comfortable pat@@ ter@@ n developing .
research by Pre@@ mi@@ er injuries L@@ t@@ d records 23 different W@@ il@@ sh@@ ere ail@@ ments since he made his debut six years ago .
he has also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ al &apos;s 15@@ 7 le@@ ag@@ ue games during the last five se@@ as@@ ons .
the wider picture for Ar@@ sen@@ al is that in six out of eight se@@ as@@ ons since 2007 @-@ 08 , they have been one of the two Pre@@ mi@@ er League clubs to lose most days through in@@ j@@ ur@@ y .
W@@ en@@ ger ac@@ cep@@ ts the potential of a vic@@ ious circ@@ le but Ar@@ sen@@ al believe that an improvement in their in@@ j@@ ur@@ y record during last season will continue .
&quot; sometimes , when you are coming back from an in@@ j@@ ur@@ y , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger .
J@@ ack is young enough to get over that .
I hope his body st@@ ab@@ il@@ ises , I am confident it will and he will make a career of the kind he de@@ serves .
with Ar@@ sen@@ al beginning their Cha@@ mp@@ ions League campaign on Wednesday night against Din@@ am@@ o Zagreb ahead of matches with C@@ hel@@ sea on Saturday and T@@ ot@@ ten@@ ham H@@ ot@@ spur next Wednesday , W@@ en@@ ger is preparing to rot@@ ate his team .
H@@ Ã©@@ c@@ tor Bel@@ ler@@ Ã­@@ n and A@@ ar@@ on Ram@@ se@@ y have not travelled to Croatia , meaning M@@ ath@@ i@@ e@@ u De@@ bu@@ ch@@ y and Ar@@ te@@ ta are likely to start .
W@@ en@@ ger may also begin with K@@ i@@ er@@ an G@@ i@@ b@@ bs and O@@ li@@ vi@@ er Gi@@ ro@@ u@@ d in place of N@@ ach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o W@@ al@@ c@@ ot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give a little bre@@ ather to players who need it , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger .
although Ar@@ sen@@ al are clear favour@@ ites to progress through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is among Europe &apos;s most in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ating .
Din@@ am@@ o are also un@@ beaten in 41 matches after producing their own &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign last season .
the stadium was s@@ h@@ ak@@ en on Tuesday night by an ear@@ th tre@@ m@@ or that meas@@ ured 3.@@ 2 on the R@@ ic@@ h@@ ter .
it was the 10th in Zagreb this year .
W@@ en@@ ger believes that Ar@@ sen@@ al have le@@ ar@@ n@@ t the les@@ son of last season &apos;s Cha@@ mp@@ ions League capit@@ ula@@ tion against Mon@@ ac@@ o and remains driven by the distant hope of managing the club to a first European Cup tri@@ ump@@ h .
&quot; this drive is im@@ men@@ se , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger .
it has never been done at Ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but , on the other hand , I am long enough to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not D@@ re@@ am@@ ers .
Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest : the co@@ medy show that ta@@ ug@@ h@@ t us serious lessons about male friendship
the absence of similar por@@ tr@@ ay@@ als in shows is g@@ lar@@ ing , particularly given how the need for men to open up is more desper@@ ate now than ever , with suicide rates am@@ ong@@ st young mal@@ es at 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20 @-@ 45 in the UK , and remains three times more common in mal@@ es than f@@ em@@ al@@ es .
in a bid to address the problem , the C@@ amp@@ a@@ ign Against Li@@ ving mis@@ er@@ ably ( calm ) announced 2015 as the Year of the Mal@@ e , aiming to challenge the culture that preven@@ ts men from seeking help when they need it .
friendship lies at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students dis@@ playing de@@ pres@@ sive symp@@ t@@ om@@ s found that if the su@@ ff@@ er@@ er had a high enough percentage of &quot; healthy mood &quot; friends , their chances of rec@@ over@@ ing doubled .
equally , for those not de@@ pressed , a circ@@ le of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ved the chances of mental challenges ar@@ ising .
but of course , for friendship to work , it needs to be ac@@ ces@@ sible in the first place .
in this age of social @-@ media led communication , with its focus on style over sub@@ stance , im@@ medi@@ acy of response is often pri@@ or@@ iti@@ sed over me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , f@@ un @-@ lov@@ ing and successful , even if in reality isolation is king .
this super@@ fic@@ ial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists term extr@@ in@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic values - our in@@ ner ye@@ ar@@ ning for personal growth and friendship - that more deeply imp@@ acts our mental health .
and as a bil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e video @-@ game cre@@ ator explained recently , money really doesn &apos;t buy greater h@@ ap@@ p@@ in@@ ess .
the beauty of Fri@@ ends was that it turned this focus on its head .
each of the char@@ ac@@ ters were not defined by their work , but rather their person@@ alities , which sh@@ one through the inter@@ action as friends .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent h@@ ug@@ s , m@@ om@@ ents watching football on the com@@ fy chair@@ s , and Ros@@ s &apos;s p@@ ining for R@@ ach@@ el , came from the knowledge that yes , men can all rela@@ te to this , even if they often hold back from fully ex@@ pl@@ oring their fe@@ el@@ ings .
as a Sam@@ ar@@ it@@ an worker explained to me : .@@ ... &quot; my l@@ ist@@ ening role to people feeling de@@ pressed and su@@ ic@@ id@@ al has really highlighted how even the s@@ mal@@ le@@ st inter@@ actions from friends can make a difference . &quot;
often the men who contact us feel unable to speak to friends .
the old ada@@ ge of &quot; getting on with it &quot; is strong , as is the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try and offer more long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it highlighted the little m@@ om@@ ents of male friendship .
as much as my objective , out@@ si@@ der status over the phone helps people in m@@ om@@ ents of desper@@ ation , the long @-@ term support comes from a close , personal family and friend network .
and so , if you attend Co@@ medy Central &apos;s Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest this weekend , with the sets fully re@@ designed in celebration , why not take your friends for a dr@@ ink at Central per@@ k .
or , better still , if in Star@@ bu@@ cks you see someone alone , give a s@@ m@@ ile and say hel@@ lo .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends is broadcasting on Co@@ medy Central from start to finish - the full 2@@ 36 ep@@ is@@ o@@ des - for # Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria scores to help P@@ S@@ G sw@@ at aside Mal@@ mo
An@@ gel D@@ i Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and E@@ din@@ son C@@ av@@ ani after scoring against Mal@@ mo .
An@@ gel D@@ i Maria scored on his Cha@@ mp@@ ions League debut to help P@@ S@@ G ease past Swedish side Mal@@ mo on Tuesday .
here &apos;s the match report and reaction to the game .
An@@ gel D@@ i Maria and E@@ din@@ son C@@ av@@ ani were on target as Paris S@@ ain@@ t @-@ Ger@@ main began their Cha@@ mp@@ ions League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2 @-@ 0 win against Mal@@ mo at the Par@@ c des Pr@@ inc@@ es on Tuesday .
di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Cha@@ mp@@ ions League debut as a P@@ S@@ G player to set the French cha@@ mp@@ ions on their way , but they missed a suc@@ ces@@ sion of opportunities before finally extending their advantage when C@@ av@@ ani headed home in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Re@@ al Madrid and S@@ h@@ ak@@ h@@ tar Don@@ et@@ s@@ k also in Group A , Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish cha@@ mp@@ ions as they target not just qu@@ al@@ ification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on their runs to the quarter @-@ finals in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a v@@ in@@ t@@ age display by La@@ ur@@ ent B@@ lan@@ c &apos;s side with Z@@ la@@ tan I@@ bra@@ h@@ im@@ ovic was@@ te@@ ful in front of goal and later being sub@@ sti@@ tu@@ ted against his home@@ town team and the club with whom he started his illu@@ stri@@ ous career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or away in the Cha@@ mp@@ ions League , so to win 2 @-@ 0 , cause our opponents problems and look comfortable at the back is a good start even if there are certain things we will need to per@@ f@@ ect as the season goes on , &quot; said B@@ lan@@ c .
it a@@ ug@@ urs well .
we wanted to win and we did , although I regret that we did not score one or two goals more .
I@@ bra@@ h@@ im@@ ovic returned after in@@ j@@ ur@@ y in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2 @-@ 2 draw at home by Bor@@ de@@ au@@ x in L@@ ig@@ ue 1 at the weekend , but he was up@@ staged in the fourth minute by D@@ i Maria .
the Argentina w@@ ing@@ er was la@@ bel@@ led as the man to take P@@ S@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was signed from Man@@ ch@@ es@@ ter United last month , and he indicated why as he ran onto Mar@@ co Ver@@ r@@ at@@ ti &apos;s pass in behind the Mal@@ mo defence before an@@ g@@ ling a beautiful finish past Jo@@ han W@@ il@@ and and into the far cor@@ ner of the net .
however , if anyone then expected P@@ S@@ G to ro@@ m@@ p to a big victory , they were to be disappointed .
Mal@@ mo , who beat C@@ el@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , lined up with nine full inter@@ nation@@ als on the field at kick @-@ off and , with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in mid@@ field , were stu@@ ff@@ y opponents .
but , save for a Nikola Djur@@ dj@@ ic shot that sli@@ d just wide of K@@ ev@@ in T@@ rap@@ p &apos;s far post in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in attack .
instead , P@@ S@@ G let themselves down at times with some was@@ te@@ ful passing and poor fin@@ ishing , not least from I@@ bra@@ h@@ im@@ ovic , who failed to con@@ ver@@ t no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by C@@ av@@ ani just after the re@@ start .
nevertheless , he proved much more ade@@ pt when it came to setting up his colleagues , and it was from an I@@ bra@@ h@@ im@@ ovic pass that D@@ i Maria sent in a cur@@ ling shot which was ti@@ pped around the post by W@@ il@@ and on 52 minutes .
the second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to C@@ av@@ ani , the U@@ ru@@ gu@@ ay@@ an heading home his sixth of the season after I@@ bra@@ h@@ im@@ ovic had f@@ lic@@ ked on a left @-@ wing cross from Ma@@ x@@ well .
that ended any ideas that Mal@@ mo had of coming back into the game , and only a super@@ b stop by W@@ il@@ and from point @-@ b@@ lan@@ k range to deny David Lu@@ iz kept the final score down before sub@@ sti@@ t@@ ut@@ e E@@ z@@ equ@@ i@@ el L@@ av@@ ez@@ zi had a goal dis@@ allowed right at the death .
Mal@@ mo coach A@@ ge H@@ ar@@ e@@ ide later admitted P@@ S@@ G were a class above his side , the Norwegian saying : &quot; our last Cha@@ mp@@ ions League game was in December last year . &quot;
since then we have only played in the Swedish le@@ ag@@ ue which is not the same level .
the qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ ers are not enough .
hat@@ s off to Paris .
it was a mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent match from them .
G@@ len@@ core raises $ 2.5 billion in share sales
Swiss @-@ based mining giant G@@ len@@ core , hit by col@@ lap@@ sing com@@ mo@@ di@@ ties prices , on Wednesday raised $ 2.5 billion via a shares sale as part of its vast debt @-@ sl@@ ash@@ ing plan .
London @-@ listed G@@ len@@ core said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about Â£ 1.6 billion to pay down debt .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is grap@@ pling with t@@ um@@ b@@ ling com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty prices as China &apos;s economic slowdown we@@ igh@@ s on demand and spar@@ ks ha@@ vo@@ c across markets .
the rights issue sent G@@ len@@ core &apos;s share price so@@ aring to the top of the London stock market in early morning deals on Wednesday .
shares jum@@ ped 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 P@@ ence on the F@@ T@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
G@@ len@@ core had last week revealed the $ 2.5 @-@ billion shares sale as part of broader plans to slas@@ h its $ 30 billion debt p@@ ile by about a third .
the company sold the new stock at 1@@ 25 P@@ ence per share , which marked a 2.@@ 4 @-@ percent dis@@ count to the closing price on Tuesday .
it off@@ lo@@ aded 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
concerns over pr@@ ol@@ on@@ ged stalled Chinese growth have slas@@ hed iron ore prices by roughly a half , as coal , cop@@ per and other com@@ mo@@ di@@ ties have fallen by 20 to 40 percent .

Mat@@ t Dam@@ on down@@ plays diversity in fil@@ m@@ making
Mat@@ t Dam@@ on confron@@ ted African @-@ American fil@@ m@@ maker E@@ ff@@ ie Bro@@ wn during a discussion on diversity saying it wasn &apos;t needed behind the s@@ cen@@ es .
during Sunday night &apos;s ep@@ is@@ o@@ de of H@@ B@@ O &apos;s Project green@@ light , the se@@ as@@ oned actor cut Bro@@ wn off while she was em@@ ph@@ as@@ iz@@ ing the need for alternative per@@ spec@@ tives regarding a black pr@@ ot@@ ag@@ on@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen s@@ cre@@ en@@ play .
&quot; when we &apos;re talking about diversity you do it in the cas@@ ting of the film not in the cas@@ ting of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on as@@ ser@@ ted .
shocked , Bro@@ wn reacted with off@@ ended dis@@ belief , let@@ ting out &quot; Ho@@ o ! W@@ o@@ w . Ok@@ ay , &quot; as The Mar@@ tian actor &apos;s comments settled in the air .
Dam@@ on and Bro@@ wn were joined by fellow producers B@@ en A@@ ff@@ le@@ ck and the F@@ ar@@ re@@ l@@ ly brothers to discuss the show &apos;s fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would urge people to think about -- who@@ ever the director is , how they &apos;re going to treat the character of Har@@ mon@@ y , &quot; Bro@@ wn initially said .
the only black character who &apos;s a ho@@ ok@@ er who gets hit by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the De@@ ar White People producer pushed for fin@@ alists Le@@ o An@@ g@@ el@@ os and K@@ ris@@ ten Bran@@ c@@ ac@@ ci@@ o for the rights to direct the film ; Dam@@ on re@@ tor@@ ted their direc@@ ting could &quot; end up giving us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion aired , social media exploded in dis@@ approval over Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
T@@ w@@ it@@ ter us@@ er M@@ r@@ Po@@ oni expressed anger toward the c@@ li@@ p writing , &quot; Mat@@ t Dam@@ on speaking over the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her is so White it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the t@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ t@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 lik@@ es since being posted .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time where ac@@ cur@@ ate rac@@ ial representation in media is at the fo@@ ref@@ r@@ on@@ t of social discussion .
after teen Michael Bro@@ wn was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement took nationwide effect , urging lawmakers and authorities to halt discrimin@@ atory practices against people of col@@ or .
in February , singer Pr@@ in@@ ce al@@ lu@@ ded to the movement while introducing the nomin@@ ees of Al@@ bu@@ m of the Year at the G@@ ram@@ my A@@ wards .
&quot; al@@ b@@ ums still matter , &quot; he said .
like books and black lives , al@@ b@@ ums still matter .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement released a statement in response to Fo@@ x News person@@ ality E@@ lis@@ ab@@ et@@ h H@@ ass@@ el@@ b@@ ec@@ k &apos;s question of whether the group should be considered a h@@ ate group .
&quot; the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Network is a love group , &quot; leaders said .
Dam@@ on was recently announced as one of a list of en@@ ter@@ ta@@ in@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ g@@ ul@@ s invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church &apos;s por@@ tr@@ ay@@ al in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja W@@ ar@@ ri@@ or &apos; cro@@ w@@ ns first champion
pro @-@ rock clim@@ ber and b@@ us@@ boy I@@ sa@@ ac Cal@@ di@@ er@@ o became the first athlete to win American N@@ in@@ ja W@@ ar@@ ri@@ or Monday night taking home the $ 1 million grand prize .
the competition show , which just wrapped up its 7th season , has never seen any com@@ peti@@ tor complete all stages of its obstacle course .
during the season fin@@ ale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ er@@ o and cam@@ er@@ am@@ an Ge@@ off Br@@ it@@ ten , made it to the final round .
the final task involved clim@@ bing a 75 @-@ fo@@ ot ro@@ pe in 30 seconds .
Br@@ it@@ ten went first completing the challenge on time , making him the first @-@ ever athlete to complete American N@@ in@@ ja W@@ ar@@ ri@@ or &apos;s g@@ ru@@ el@@ ing stage 4 , however , Cal@@ di@@ er@@ o finished the challenge a full three seconds faster making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ er@@ o spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still in shock about winning the $ 1 million grand prize .
&quot; I mean it &apos;s ama@@ z@@ ing to think about , like I &apos;ve never made or lived off more than $ 10,000 a year , &quot; I@@ sa@@ ac told E ! of his serious pay @-@ b@@ ump .
so to all of a su@@ d@@ den ... like I can &apos;t even ima@@ g@@ ine what it &apos;s going to be like ... the future is unknown .
executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hol@@ l@@ y@@ wood Re@@ por@@ ter to discuss the fin@@ ale and why , despite Br@@ it@@ ten being the first ever com@@ peti@@ tor to finish the course , won &apos;t be awarded any prize money .
by the rules , the money goes to the fas@@ test person .
&quot; if there &apos;s more than one fin@@ is@@ her , the one with the fas@@ test time gets it , &quot; said We@@ ed .
as much as the money is a won@@ der@@ ful prize and life changing , he does get the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he har@@ b@@ ors any ill will about it .
he &apos;s just so happy to have done what he &apos;s done .
he &apos;s received t@@ ons of ac@@ co@@ la@@ des from fans .
he &apos;s such a great gu@@ y , and a family man .
he &apos;s a her@@ o to his kids and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; I@@ f I was going to be beat by someone , I &apos;m g@@ la@@ d it &apos;s I@@ sa@@ ac . &quot;
and I think I@@ sa@@ ac would have felt the same way if they roles were rever@@ sed .

D@@ et@@ ro@@ it Ti@@ gers ti@@ p@@ to@@ e past Min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a T@@ wins
Min@@ ne@@ ap@@ ol@@ is -- The second half the season has@@ n &apos;t been a lot of f@@ un for the D@@ et@@ ro@@ it Ti@@ gers .
once one of the best teams in bas@@ eb@@ all , the Ti@@ gers are now in last place in the American League Central .
reducing to being a sp@@ o@@ il@@ er , the Ti@@ gers played the part per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly Tuesday , beating the Min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a T@@ wins 5 @-@ 4 at Tar@@ get Fi@@ el@@ d .
the T@@ wins squ@@ an@@ dered a chance to clim@@ b to within one @-@ half game of the H@@ ou@@ st@@ on A@@ st@@ ros for the second American League w@@ il@@ d @-@ card spot .
for D@@ et@@ ro@@ it , if only for one night , it was a return of the three @-@ letter F @-@ word that has been so elu@@ sive over much of the season &apos;s second half .
&quot; all wins are f@@ un , no matter how it happens , &quot; Ti@@ gers manager Bra@@ d A@@ us@@ mu@@ s said .
Ti@@ gers p@@ it@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Sim@@ on made his early offensive support hold up , as D@@ et@@ ro@@ it scored three times in the first two in@@ nings , then tac@@ ked one in the sixth and one more in the ninth .
Sim@@ on ( 13 @-@ 9 ) p@@ it@@ ched 6 1 / 3 in@@ nings and allowed three runs .
it was only his third quality start in his past nine out@@ ings .
&quot; I just want to finish strong this year , &quot; Sim@@ on said .
it &apos;s hard for the bul@@ l@@ p@@ en to th@@ row every game , and that &apos;s why I want to go deep into the game .
Ti@@ gers designated hit@@ ter Victor M@@ art@@ in@@ e@@ z had three hits and dro@@ ve in two runs , his first R@@ B@@ I@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was M@@ art@@ in@@ e@@ z &apos;s first three @-@ hit night since he had four hits against the Se@@ at@@ t@@ le mar@@ in@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; he sw@@ un@@ g the b@@ at well , &quot; A@@ us@@ mu@@ s said .
he looked good in ( bat@@ ting practice ) , looked noti@@ ce@@ ably better in B@@ P , and he carried it right into the game .
tra@@ iling by three runs in the bottom of the seventh in@@ ning , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into the game .
Center fi@@ el@@ der B@@ y@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton led off the in@@ ning with a double down the left field line .
right fi@@ el@@ der A@@ ar@@ on H@@ ic@@ ks reached on a bun@@ t single , and Sim@@ on got second bas@@ em@@ an Bri@@ an Do@@ z@@ ier to strike out sw@@ ing@@ ing before being lifted for left @-@ han@@ der Bla@@ ine har@@ dy .
har@@ dy w@@ al@@ k@@ ed M@@ au@@ er , the only man he faced , ahead of ro@@ ok@@ ie designated hit@@ ter M@@ ig@@ u@@ el San@@ o , who ri@@ pped a two @-@ run single to left off right @-@ han@@ der D@@ re@@ w Ver@@ ha@@ g@@ en .
with a p@@ air of run@@ ners on and the t@@ ying run at second , Ver@@ ha@@ g@@ en got third bas@@ em@@ an T@@ rev@@ or P@@ l@@ ou@@ ff@@ e to ground into a double play .
it was the major @-@ le@@ ag@@ ue @-@ leading 27th time this season that P@@ l@@ ou@@ ff@@ e hit into a DP .
after D@@ et@@ ro@@ it tac@@ ked on an insurance run in the top of the ninth , M@@ au@@ er ri@@ pped an R@@ B@@ I double to the gap against Ti@@ gers closer B@@ ru@@ ce R@@ on@@ don to make it 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ han@@ der struck out San@@ o on three p@@ it@@ ches for his fifth save .
D@@ et@@ ro@@ it took advantage of a ru@@ st@@ y P@@ hi@@ l H@@ ug@@ hes in the early going .
the Ti@@ gers posted three runs in the first two in@@ nings against the veteran right @-@ han@@ der , who came off the disabled list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back inf@@ lam@@ mation .
&quot; obviously not the start I &apos;d like to have , &quot; H@@ ug@@ hes said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable as I went along and felt I was able to ex@@ ec@@ ute some pre@@ t@@ ty good p@@ it@@ ches there in the third in@@ ning . &quot;
after getting the le@@ ad@@ off bat@@ ter in the first , Hus@@ hes gave up a single to second bas@@ em@@ an I@@ an K@@ ins@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk to right fi@@ el@@ der J@@ .@@ D@@ . M@@ art@@ in@@ e@@ z brought up Victor M@@ art@@ in@@ e@@ z , who sing@@ led up the middle for the first run of the game .
Victor M@@ art@@ in@@ e@@ z sn@@ apped his 0 @-@ for @-@ 21 st@@ re@@ ak with run@@ ners in scoring position .
third bas@@ em@@ an Nic@@ k Cas@@ tel@@ lan@@ os followed with a single to right , scoring another run , but Victor M@@ art@@ in@@ e@@ z was thrown out trying to advance to third , ending the threat .
the Ti@@ gers added on in the second , getting a one @-@ out double from cat@@ cher James Mc@@ Can@@ n and a two @-@ out single by cen@@ ter fi@@ el@@ der An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ose to make it 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big hit , &quot; T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or said .
he didn &apos;t hit it particularly well , but he got it in the right spot .
H@@ ug@@ hes , who was on a p@@ it@@ ch count , p@@ it@@ ched a s@@ co@@ re@@ less third in@@ ning before being replaced by right @-@ handed reli@@ ever A@@ .@@ J@@ . A@@ ch@@ ter .
H@@ ug@@ hes was charged with three runs on six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Ti@@ gers R@@ H@@ P A@@ ni@@ b@@ al San@@ che@@ z was shut down with a strain in his th@@ ro@@ wing sho@@ ul@@ der .
he will be exam@@ ined by Dr@@ . James An@@ dre@@ ws , who performed surgery on San@@ che@@ z &apos;s sho@@ ul@@ der back in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the disabled list with a sho@@ ul@@ der strain since mid @-@ August , was scheduled to be activ@@ ated for a Wednesday start .
with San@@ che@@ z out , L@@ H@@ P Daniel N@@ or@@ ri@@ s will come off the D@@ L to start against the T@@ wins .

X@@ I urges to open economy wider to world
the economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping told a group tasked with ste@@ ering reform on Tuesday .
&quot; China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise , and improve opening @-@ up policies , &quot; he said , addressing the 16th Me@@ et@@ ing of the Central Le@@ ading Group for deepening O@@ ver@@ all Reform .
promoting opening up while pushing forward reforms will add new impetus and v@@ it@@ ality , and provide new room for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the leading group adopted a series of gu@@ ide@@ lines including a negative list re@@ gu@@ la@@ ting market access , rela@@ x@@ ation of border @-@ control policies , encouraging state @-@ owned enterprises ( SO@@ E ) to absor@@ b private capital and over@@ ha@@ uling the resident registration system .
according to the statement , a negative list , identi@@ fying sectors and businesses that are off @-@ limits for investment , will be drawn up .
the system will be gradually tested and improved through trial pro@@ gra@@ ms .
the move is significant as it will give the market a bigger role in al@@ loc@@ ating resources , ensuring a law @-@ based business environment and making the market more open , the statement said .
the government will also lo@@ os@@ en controls on the powers it delegates to companies , making sure that companies decide how to run their businesses .
the statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic co@@ operation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
in a bid to open up state @-@ controlled sectors , more areas will be open to private investment .
&quot; the government will not change its policy toward foreign investment , and will protect the la@@ w@@ ful interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; said the statement .
in addition , it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permits , or &quot; green card , &quot; by op@@ ti@@ m@@ iz@@ ing requirements and stream@@ lining the application process .
guaran@@ te@@ eing lawyers &apos; right to practice and nur@@ turing professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting was also attended by Pre@@ mi@@ er L@@ i K@@ e@@ q@@ i@@ an@@ g , and senior leaders Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ han@@ g G@@ a@@ ol@@ i , according to a statement released after the meeting .
m@@ ini @-@ bags are the he@@ ight of fashion - Zaman Ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er Saturday S@@ up@@ ple@@ ment
the subject eventually returned to bags in the world of fashion .
the recent outstanding trend is those min@@ i@@ at@@ ures ...
it is possible to say that the small bags that are placed next to the big ones draw attention .
it is said that small is beautiful .
this point of view also applies to bags .
even though we didn &apos;t tir@@ e of w@@ al@@ k@@ ing the streets with almost @-@ su@@ it@@ case @-@ sized bags , the ti@@ de has started to turn and bags are inc@@ lined to be smaller .
small bags already existed but they appeared before us in minim@@ ised ver@@ sions of big sho@@ ul@@ der bags .
only your telephone , credit card and ke@@ ys fit inside these tiny bags .
starting with C@@ Ã©@@ line and Her@@ m@@ Ã¨@@ s , the trend spread with P@@ ra@@ da .
trans@@ forming this ba@@ g man@@ ia into an interest for m@@ ini @-@ bags has affected the newly emerging models .
Lo@@ e@@ we presented the f@@ un bags it created in two siz@@ es .
among the bags , in the shape of pan@@ das , po@@ lar be@@ ars and ele@@ p@@ han@@ ts , the most outstanding ones are the ele@@ ph@@ ant @-@ shap@@ ed ones .
presented by luxury br@@ an@@ ds with ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al names , m@@ ini ver@@ sions of the big bags seem to attract red @-@ car@@ p@@ et c@@ ele@@ bri@@ ties most .
one of the most popular is the &quot; B@@ ir@@ kin &quot; ba@@ g Her@@ m@@ Ã¨@@ s created as a de@@ dic@@ ation to Jan@@ e B@@ ir@@ kin .
even though Jan@@ e B@@ ir@@ kin said that she does not want her name to be remember@@ ed with a ba@@ g , she is now im@@ pr@@ in@@ ted in the memory in this way .
fashion weeks led to the p@@ op@@ ul@@ ar@@ ization of the m@@ ini @-@ ba@@ g trend .
con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , m@@ ini @-@ bags have been prominent on the po@@ di@@ um .
since they are very small , it is not really possible to wear them on your arm .
they can be wor@@ n across the body with their long st@@ rap@@ s .
however , we saw these st@@ rap@@ s tan@@ g@@ led around the w@@ r@@ ist@@ s of the models on the po@@ di@@ um .
F@@ en@@ di is one of those taking the m@@ ini @-@ ba@@ g theme one step forward .
it has some advice for those who cannot fit into m@@ ini @-@ bags but cannot abandon them either .
m@@ ini @-@ bags as a friend of big bags .
how ?
by trans@@ forming the m@@ ini @-@ bags into a ba@@ g or@@ n@@ am@@ ent that can be at@@ t@@ ac@@ hed to bigger ones .
featured on the po@@ di@@ ums , this presentation has taken to the streets very quickly .
let &apos;s see what else we will see !
D@@ en@@ im changes s@@ kin
Turkey is on a level that can compete with world br@@ an@@ ds in terms of den@@ im .
the experience gained in production has been en@@ ri@@ ched with design .
L@@ of@@ t is one of them .
we now see that black design@@ s , having been few in the past , take their place on the shel@@ ves every season .
D@@ en@@ im found its clos@@ est friend in a season when black c@@ olo@@ urs are on the rise .
le@@ ather pieces and design@@ s with le@@ ather details come to the fo@@ ref@@ r@@ on@@ t as the re@@ bel@@ li@@ ous friend of den@@ im .
generally , z@@ ip@@ per@@ ed short design@@ s called &quot; motor@@ bi@@ ke &quot; are most prominent .
the strong mood of le@@ ather complete with black pieces ; chi@@ ff@@ on long blo@@ uses and b@@ right swe@@ at@@ sh@@ ir@@ ts , provides a cas@@ ual and chi@@ c appearance .
in the past , young people wor@@ e den@@ im and wanted to be lost in the crowd .
it was thought that it would save the day .
no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays , young people want to wear design@@ s that are comfortable and em@@ ph@@ as@@ ise their style at the same time .
within this perspective , it can be said that L@@ of@@ t correc@@ tly understood its target group with their collec@@ tions and ac@@ ces@@ sor@@ ies it designed
a small step for Ban@@ k@@ sy , a giant step for the &quot; Global &quot;
bringing together the works of my@@ ster@@ ious street artist Ban@@ k@@ sy , the world premi@@ Ã¨@@ re of the collection &quot; The Art of Ban@@ k@@ sy &quot; was held in Istanbul .
a product of 15 years of work from the artist and gathering the origin@@ als of 85 works for the first time , the exhibition is the first in the Global Kar@@ ak@@ Ã¶@@ y building .
the first exhibition by the my@@ ster@@ ious street artist Ban@@ k@@ sy in Istanbul opened y@@ es@@ ter@@ day in the Global Kar@@ ak@@ Ã¶@@ y ( R@@ Ä±@@ h@@ t@@ Ä±@@ m Street ) .
the world famous artist , who conce@@ als his identity and uses an ali@@ as , was not present at the exhibition opening of course .
we also don &apos;t know if he came to Istanbul or not .
however , Ban@@ k@@ sy is not aware of this exhibition according to Ste@@ ve L@@ az@@ ar@@ i@@ das , cur@@ ator of the exhibition .
it is not necessary to receive permission from him .
the reason is that old friends Ban@@ k@@ sy and L@@ az@@ ar@@ i@@ das par@@ ted company with each other after 12 years .
the exhibi@@ ted works were partly collected from L@@ az@@ ar@@ i@@ das and collec@@ tors .
however , there are issues that Ban@@ k@@ sy fans are cur@@ ious about .
what would Ban@@ k@@ sy think about the exhibition &quot; The Art of Ban@@ k@@ sy &quot; which brings together 85 of his works ?
for example , what would he think of entering the exhibition with a ticket ( 35 T@@ L ) ? what would he say if he saw the 800 square metre gallery space with a small store created at the end ?
would he raise his voice against the fact that cl@@ ot@@ h bags , w@@ alle@@ ts and nec@@ k@@ la@@ ces are pr@@ in@@ ted with works of his such as Red bal@@ lo@@ on G@@ ir@@ l , ma@@ id , s@@ m@@ ile No@@ w , which draws attention to the wo@@ unds of the world ?
Ban@@ k@@ sy fol@@ lo@@ w@@ ers feel disappointed by the turning of an exhibition of an artist who conce@@ als his identity and has an an@@ arch@@ ist sou@@ l into such consumer goods .
this is certainly not the style of Ban@@ k@@ sy .
nevertheless , get your limited av@@ ail@@ ability tickets before they are sold out !
small for Ban@@ k@@ sy but giant for the g@@ lob@@ alised world , the exhibition &quot; The Art of Ban@@ k@@ sy &quot; can be seen until April .
they are de@@ sp@@ ic@@ able and c@@ ru@@ el .
let them di@@ g di@@ t@@ ches .
President Recep Tayyip Er@@ do@@ Ä@@ an continued his reaction against the academics that signed the declaration .
Er@@ do@@ Ä@@ an said , &quot; T@@ he@@ y are c@@ ru@@ el , they are de@@ sp@@ ic@@ able . &quot;
because those who stand by the op@@ pres@@ sors are op@@ pres@@ sors .
he said , &quot; S@@ in@@ ce they stand by those who sla@@ ug@@ h@@ tered , they committed the same off@@ ence . &quot;
laying f@@ lo@@ w@@ ers at the scene of the explosion in S@@ ul@@ tan@@ ah@@ met , Recep Tayyip Er@@ do@@ Ä@@ an said , &quot; I shared our gri@@ ef both with the German President and German Chancellor because of the fact that 10 of our German friends were killed during this action in S@@ ul@@ tan@@ ah@@ met Square that is full of history and civil@@ ization , and simply a square of peace - particularly in a place like this , near to the German F@@ oun@@ tain . &quot;
f@@ ir@@ st@@ ly I would like to con@@ v@@ ey my con@@ d@@ ol@@ ences to the German people , especially to the families of the victims .
he said , &quot; O@@ ur fight against terrorism will continue with determination . &quot;
continuing his reaction towards the academics who signed the declaration , Er@@ do@@ Ä@@ an stated the following : &quot; I condemn again and strongly condemn in particular the academics who put their sign@@ ature under this sla@@ ug@@ h@@ ter by publishing a &quot; p@@ it@@ ch @-@ black &quot; declaration even in the face of all these terrorist incidents . &quot;
I want our nation to understand much more closely who is who ; in other words , having a title of professor , assistant professor does not make a person li@@ ter@@ ate .
they are completely dark people .
they are c@@ ru@@ el , they are de@@ sp@@ ic@@ able .
since they stand by those who sla@@ ug@@ h@@ tered , they also committed the same off@@ ence .
what do these dark academics think about those ba@@ bi@@ es , 3 @-@ year old M@@ ev@@ l@@ Ã¼@@ de who died a m@@ art@@ y@@ r with her father in the incident that occurred in Ã@@ Ä±@@ n@@ ar ?
how can they allow their con@@ science to stand by her kil@@ lers ?
I am inv@@ iting all the judicial authorities , university sen@@ ates to do their duty for these acts against our constitution and laws .
y@@ es@@ ter@@ day , I said that all the necessary steps should be taken rapidly .
let them do whatever they do out there .
if they want to do politics , let them do politics in parliament .
if they cannot do it in parliament , let them go and di@@ g di@@ t@@ ches or go to the mountains .
I am saying it clearly and exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly .

after An@@ g@@ Ã©@@ li@@ l was diagnos@@ ed with cancer in 1999 , C@@ el@@ ine D@@ ion took a break from her career .
&quot; while I was searching for two w@@ rest@@ ler children , I found 26 people &quot;
the second documentary from M@@ et@@ e G@@ Ã¼@@ m@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ han , &quot; Y@@ oun@@ g W@@ rest@@ ler , &quot; 6@@ 6th .
it became the first Turkish documentary to be selected in the &quot; G@@ ener@@ ation K@@ plus &quot; section of the Berlin Film Festival ( February 11 @-@ 21 ) .
originally from E@@ dir@@ ne but with a production company in the Netherlands , G@@ Ã¼@@ m@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ han talked about how and why he shot the documentary which he completed in the summer of 2014 .
telling the story of six students in a bo@@ ar@@ ding school from A@@ mas@@ ya who aimed at becoming the world champion in the field of wrestling , the documentary &quot; Y@@ oun@@ g w@@ rest@@ lers &quot; will compete in the &quot; G@@ ener@@ ation K@@ plus &quot; section of the Berlin Film Festival .
being the first made @-@ in @-@ Turkey documentary to be selected in this section , Y@@ oun@@ g w@@ rest@@ lers is one of the candidates for the Cr@@ y@@ st@@ al Be@@ ar award .
M@@ et@@ e G@@ Ã¼@@ m@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ han is originally from E@@ dir@@ ne even though he was born and raised in the Netherlands .
he l@@ ist@@ en@@ ed to stories about gre@@ ase wrestling from his grand@@ father and watched com@@ peti@@ tions in Turkey , where he came during the summer when he was a child .
&quot; there are not only political problems in Turkey . &quot;
I wanted to tell the world what is going on in An@@ at@@ ol@@ ia other than that .
with the idea , &quot; wrestling , one of our an@@ ces@@ tor sports , is not well known , &quot; for example , he brought together 6 directors and wanted to create a documentary project .
this project remained in@@ con@@ c@@ lu@@ sive but news in a magazine he read on a plane opened the door to another project for G@@ Ã¼@@ m@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ han .
&quot; we st@@ ay@@ ed in a sugar factory &quot;
trac@@ ing the article that talked about two little w@@ rest@@ ler brothers aged 10 @-@ 11 , M@@ et@@ e G@@ Ã¼@@ m@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ han went so Sam@@ sun , where their family lives .
the father of the children did not give permission to sho@@ ot a documentary .
G@@ Ã¼@@ m@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ han talked about how he over@@ came this challenge as follows : &quot; I thought about what I could do all day long . &quot;
&quot; because the support of the Ministry of Culture might be withdrawn . &quot;
the father mentioned a bo@@ ar@@ ding school in A@@ mas@@ ya , where the children would go .
I thought of going there .
while I was searching for two children , I found 26 children with an interest in wrestling .
we started shooting preparations and fin@@ al@@ ized the author@@ ization .
we did not even have a place to stay .
&quot; we st@@ ay@@ ed in the dor@@ mit@@ ory of a sugar factory . &quot;
language was the biggest challenge posed for the director by the documentary , the shooting of which was completed in 3 weeks .
st@@ at@@ ing that three different languages were spoken on the set of the film in which a foreign director of cin@@ e@@ mato@@ graphy and a so@@ un@@ d@@ man worked , G@@ Ã¼@@ m@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ han said , &quot; I did not know what I would come across during the sho@@ ot . &quot;
he says , &quot; T@@ he@@ y did not know Turkish either . &quot;
young w@@ rest@@ lers focuses on the story of six of the 26 child w@@ rest@@ lers .
Baran , who was brought up by his grand@@ father and had a weight problem , Har@@ un , who could not participate in training because he broke his arm , B@@ ey@@ t@@ ul@@ la@@ h , who is ambitious but has some health problems , Ã@@ m@@ it , who is the pre@@ t@@ ty boy of the school , the youngest champion Ahmet and Mu@@ ham@@ med , who holds the group together ...
M@@ et@@ e G@@ Ã¼@@ m@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ han says of working with the children as follows : &quot; I let them be completely natural . &quot;
I tried to use only Mu@@ ham@@ med everywhere .
I shot the training for the first one and a half weeks .
I wanted that the children act as if there were no cam@@ era .
&quot; fortun@@ ately they quickly adap@@ ted . &quot;
it was a surprise to be selected for Berlin
st@@ at@@ ing that he did not expect Y@@ oun@@ g w@@ rest@@ lers to be selected for the Berlin Film Festival , M@@ et@@ e G@@ Ã¼@@ m@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ han said , &quot; We were ready , but it was a surprise for us to be selected for Berlin . &quot;
young w@@ rest@@ lers is not a sports documentary , it is a production that n@@ ar@@ rates the struggle of the children and a sli@@ ce of their life .
he says , &quot; I wanted to highlight the struggle of children with family problems to find an identity and their story of cop@@ ing with their problems . &quot;
support from the world of art for the academics
the stor@@ m that broke out after the declaration of &quot; The Initiative of academics for Peace , &quot; went so far that investigations were opened against the academics and they were taken into custody y@@ es@@ ter@@ day ; but at the same time , there are also statements of support ar@@ ri@@ ving one after another .
the first support came from the li@@ ter@@ ati , among whom there are many famous people .
film makers expressed their support the day before y@@ es@@ ter@@ day , and theatre actors did so y@@ es@@ ter@@ day .
in the ex@@ plan@@ ation made with the signatures of 13@@ 8 theatre actors , it was stated , &quot; We , as artists working in the field of theatre and stage @-@ performance , stand by this hon@@ our@@ able meeting of academics making a call for peace ; and we state that we stand by the freedom of expression , equality , right to life and un@@ conditional peace . &quot;
it was said , &quot; We add our voice to the discussion and peace calls from the academics with all our heart and con@@ science . &quot;
more than 400 film makers including D@@ en@@ iz T@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ k@@ al@@ i , A@@ ti@@ l@@ la Ã@@ z@@ de@@ m@@ i@@ ro@@ Ä@@ l@@ u , N@@ adi@@ r Sar@@ Ä±@@ b@@ ac@@ ak , Ã@@ z@@ can Al@@ per , Ser@@ ra Y@@ Ä±@@ l@@ ma@@ z , On@@ ur Ã@@ n@@ l@@ Ã¼ , Y@@ e@@ Å@@ im U@@ st@@ a@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u , P@@ el@@ in Es@@ mer , T@@ ol@@ ga Kar@@ a@@ Ã§@@ e@@ li@@ k stated that , &quot; We stand by free thought and art . &quot;
without using but , however and if : &quot; we won &apos;t take part in this crime ! &quot;
they supported the academics by saying , &quot; We stand by the Initiative of the academics for Peace . &quot;
the S@@ cre@@ en@@ writers Association ( S@@ Ä°@@ Y@@ AD ) also made a statement and said , &quot; We stand by the academics , who were made the target of a l@@ y@@ n@@ ching campaign . &quot;
the Initiative of academics for Peace called for peace and discussion from the government with si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ous statements in Ankara and Istanbul on January 11 ; and it published a declaration under the title , &quot; We are not party to this crime . &quot;
in addition to the 11@@ 28 academics from 8@@ 9 universities , the text was signed by th@@ in@@ kers such as No@@ am Ch@@ om@@ sky , David Har@@ v@@ ey , Im@@ man@@ u@@ el W@@ al@@ ler@@ ste@@ in , Ju@@ di@@ th B@@ ut@@ ler , and E@@ ti@@ en@@ ne B@@ ali@@ bar , who have worldwide f@@ ame through their the@@ or@@ ies and books .
President Er@@ do@@ Ä@@ an and Prime Minister D@@ av@@ ut@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u defined the declaration of the academics as &quot; support for terrorism &quot; and criticised it very har@@ sh@@ ly ; and Er@@ do@@ Ä@@ an called on organiz@@ ations to &quot; do what is needed . &quot;
after this call , some universities fired the academics and the prosecution office brought an ex @-@ o@@ ff@@ ic@@ i@@ o prosecution .
many academics were taken into custody y@@ es@@ ter@@ day .
I am your fan , ple@@ ase help me !
H@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ re@@ m S@@ ul@@ tan &apos;s red ha@@ ir , Ber@@ en &apos;s n@@ ose , J@@ us@@ tin &apos;s ha@@ ir ...
trying to look like c@@ ele@@ bri@@ ties is considered normal to some extent but it is regarded as a psychological dis@@ order after the point that it starts to completely affect your life .
&quot; c@@ ele@@ br@@ ity wor@@ ship syn@@ dro@@ me , &quot; also known as &quot; the syn@@ dro@@ me of wor@@ shipping famous people &quot; is a matter that has already become an academic issue around the world and is a newly spoken about issue in our country .
it can be considered normal to some extent that la@@ di@@ es run to the ha@@ ir sal@@ ons with photos of c@@ ele@@ bri@@ ties .
however , we should not forget the &quot; H@@ Ã¼@@ r@@ re@@ m S@@ ul@@ tan &quot; year when all the youth w@@ al@@ k@@ ed around with red Irish ha@@ ir .
it was already reported that &quot; Ber@@ en &apos;s n@@ ose &quot; led the way in plastic sur@@ ger@@ ies in 2015 .
the situation is not so very different on the part of men .
once upon a time , d@@ res@@ sing like P@@ ola@@ t A@@ le@@ m@@ dar was a cust@@ om .
now a totally different trend prev@@ ail@@ s everywhere .
our sur@@ ro@@ un@@ dings are full of young boys that are cop@@ ies of J@@ us@@ tin Bi@@ e@@ ber .
it is at such an extent that the following qu@@ ot@@ e of us@@ ele@@ s@@ s information was read thousands of times : &quot; f@@ ir@@ st@@ ly , when you go to the ha@@ ir@@ d@@ res@@ s@@ er , have your ha@@ ir cut at the sides , in other words , the part over and around your e@@ ars up to the up@@ per part of your head . &quot;
however , the sides should be short .
after the cutting process is over , you should shape your ha@@ ir ligh@@ tly with water .
after the shap@@ ing process , fix your ha@@ ir with the help of sp@@ ray .
&quot; it is necessary to shape it when it is w@@ et to get J@@ us@@ tin ha@@ ir . &quot;
all of these issues have already become academic subjects around the world , but they re@@ mind us of the newly spoken &quot; c@@ ele@@ br@@ ity wor@@ ship syn@@ dro@@ me , &quot; in other words &quot; the syn@@ dro@@ me of wor@@ shipping famous people . &quot;
fans of c@@ ele@@ bri@@ ties are considered as a &quot; bun@@ d@@ le of love . &quot;
artists always pri@@ de themselves on their fan numbers and how their fans affect them .
lu@@ c@@ kil@@ y , psych@@ ology does not consider the condition so simply .
in particular , it is much discussed that ad@@ o@@ les@@ c@@ ents make decisions about what they eat and dr@@ ink , what they listen to , what they wear in accordance with c@@ ele@@ bri@@ ties .
excessive lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty to people presented as un@@ at@@ ta@@ in@@ able , and taking them as role models is defined as a mental dis@@ order .
senior psych@@ ologist S@@ Ã¼@@ me@@ y@@ y@@ e Dem@@ ir ac@@ cep@@ ts that Turkey falls behind in terms of studies into this field .
however she does not fail to no@@ ti@@ ce the fact that families are gradually becoming con@@ sci@@ ous : &quot; one of the basic issues in the science of psych@@ ology is people being at peace with themselves and finding peace in their identi@@ ties . &quot;
in the past , it was not taken seriously if children filled their rooms with posters and played the role of someone .
this situation is now changing .
their parents feel the need to intervene in the situation .
&quot; pas@@ sion@@ ate lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty to someone is a sign of the fact that something has gone wrong in the teen &apos;s life . &quot;
fans jum@@ ping onto the emo@@ tional speed train
interest in c@@ ele@@ br@@ ity is safe in moder@@ ation .
Dem@@ ir advis@@ es to be careful of symp@@ t@@ om@@ s such as not wan@@ ting them to mar@@ ry , en@@ v@@ ying their sp@@ ous@@ es and pre@@ fer@@ ring their clo@@ thing st@@ y@@ les .
as the name imp@@ lies , we are talking about famous people .
being cur@@ ious about them and having an interest in their life is considered normal to some extent .
however , young people over@@ stepping the limits are pre@@ val@@ ent according to the senior psych@@ ologist : &quot; when there is no one in the family or the sur@@ ro@@ un@@ dings to serve as a model for v@@ ir@@ tu@@ es and good behaviour , this gap is certainly filled . &quot;
good examples do not always emerge .
&quot; children also cop@@ y the negative things . &quot;
when we cons@@ ul@@ t her about how we should approach them , S@@ Ã¼@@ me@@ y@@ y@@ e Dem@@ ir starts by remin@@ ding us that the syn@@ dro@@ me of c@@ ele@@ br@@ ity wor@@ ship is seen mostly in ad@@ o@@ les@@ c@@ ence .
the problem is more easily overcome once it is taken into consideration that ad@@ o@@ les@@ c@@ ents may be in@@ secure .
on one hand , we are comp@@ la@@ ining about the li@@ mit@@ ations of family and on the other hand we are facing young people expecting support and aff@@ ec@@ tion from them : &quot; we are obliged to take into consideration their emo@@ tional ups and dow@@ ns . &quot;
new research put forward that they are forced by the changes oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ing in their bra@@ ins .
&quot; it should be taken n@@ atur@@ ally if an ad@@ o@@ les@@ cent , jum@@ ping onto the emo@@ tional speed train , is at@@ t@@ ac@@ hed to someone ; and they should be ap@@ pro@@ ac@@ hed deli@@ ca@@ te@@ ly . &quot;
it is possible to change behaviour
senior psych@@ ologist S@@ Ã¼@@ me@@ y@@ y@@ e Dem@@ ir , remin@@ ds us of the duties falling into the share of parents to overcome c@@ ele@@ br@@ ity wor@@ ship syn@@ dro@@ me :
identify their emo@@ tional problem and be sure that you are calm before bringing up the issue .
never let them sup@@ press their emo@@ tions .
express your respect for their ad@@ oration in order to encourage freedom .
instead of teaching them by re@@ pri@@ man@@ ding , serve as a good model for them , discuss the people that can be a role model to them .
try to talk together about the roles of c@@ ele@@ bri@@ ties in our daily life .
it would be hel@@ p@@ ful to read books about the real world of c@@ ele@@ bri@@ ties together .
change your communication approach to the form of ad@@ ul@@ t to ad@@ ul@@ t .
do not forget the fact that addi@@ ction and mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ation use the brain in the same way .
tell your child that er@@ r@@ ors are opportunities for change , and accept them as they are .
get the support of specialists dealing with being a fan .
those who get angry and those who ad@@ m@@ ire both wor@@ ship
at the base of the syn@@ dro@@ me of c@@ ele@@ br@@ ity wor@@ ship there is a need to appeal and get help from someone .
it is in fact a un@@ prev@@ ent@@ able love , a call for help .
but unfortunately it is not perceived like this .
furthermore , this problem is so widespread that it is not possible to narrow it down to a country or a continent .
Dr@@ . Rec@@ a@@ i Y@@ ah@@ y@@ a@@ o@@ Ä@@ l@@ u draws attention to the fact that there are certain people that occup@@ y the television in every country .
the syn@@ dro@@ me man@@ i@@ f@@ es@@ ts itself mostly in an at@@ t@@ ac@@ hment to the c@@ ele@@ bri@@ ties : &quot; they are extraordinary . &quot;
most people do not have their opportunities .
those who have do not live their life by acting like them .
it is because they do not em@@ br@@ ace this life or they do not d@@ are to do it .
&quot; however , both those who do not have the opportunities , and those who have the opportunities but do not live like them continue to watch them an@@ gr@@ ily . &quot;
there is no difference between those who c@@ ov@@ et them and those who watch them bur@@ sting with anger .
both ad@@ m@@ ire them in@@ war@@ dly .
they earn money without trouble , they are in ma@@ g@@ az@@ ines daily .
even kno@@ wing this is enough to increase their ad@@ mir@@ ation .
other advice from the senior psych@@ ologist S@@ Ã¼@@ me@@ y@@ y@@ e Dem@@ ir is to question the reality of these lives .
we should not fail to no@@ ti@@ ce that arti@@ fic@@ ial lives are being talked about .
support from the surrounding people steps in for the person who feels pas@@ sion@@ ately about c@@ ele@@ br@@ ity .
however , people insist on rejecting the fact that the c@@ ele@@ bri@@ ties they ad@@ m@@ ire also have problems like them .

should I undergo a cho@@ lec@@ y@@ st@@ os@@ t@@ om@@ y ? - F@@ am@@ ily @-@ Health News - Zaman Ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er
Dr@@ . F@@ ev@@ zi Ã@@ z@@ g@@ Ã¶@@ n@@ Ã¼@@ l answers the questions in his col@@ um@@ n in the M@@ ey@@ dan Ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er .@@ .
I have gal@@ l@@ stones , I have sto@@ ma@@ ch ache when I get up every morning and after me@@ als ; and I visit the to@@ il@@ et 2 times or more everyday .
could it prevent me from losing weight ?
I have now started to use al@@ k@@ al@@ ine , but my appe@@ ti@@ te for me@@ als has@@ n &apos;t dimin@@ ished , I cannot lose any weight .
it has been the same since my ch@@ ild@@ hood .
what should I do ?
in your opinion , should I undergo a cho@@ lec@@ y@@ st@@ os@@ t@@ om@@ y ?
answer : most of the time , an infection ac@@ companies gal@@ l@@ stones .
this complaint of sto@@ ma@@ ch ach@@ es , oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ing soon after me@@ als , is a sign of the fact that your gal@@ l@@ bla@@ d@@ der tigh@@ tens when you eat and you sp@@ ill the infected g@@ all into the in@@ te@@ st@@ ines .
distur@@ bed by the infected g@@ all , the in@@ te@@ st@@ ines try to quickly exp@@ el this g@@ all .
this is why you visit the to@@ il@@ et frequently .
since you visit the to@@ il@@ et frequently and what you eat is expelled without being di@@ ges@@ ted , losing weight becomes s@@ lower .
in my opinion , you should have this condition treated .
if you go to a g@@ ast@@ ro@@ en@@ ter@@ ologist and the condition is detec@@ ted as I said , you can be free from this condition by using anti@@ bio@@ tics .
however , you may eventually have to undergo a cho@@ lec@@ y@@ st@@ os@@ t@@ om@@ y .
Al@@ k@@ al@@ ine pro@@ bio@@ tics may decrease your symp@@ t@@ ons but it does not c@@ ure them .
I advis@@ e you to use al@@ k@@ al@@ ine pro@@ bio@@ tics any@@ way .
because this pro@@ bi@@ otic pow@@ der is the biggest help in losing weight .
I eat too much under stress
de@@ ar si@@ r , I eat continu@@ ously when I am stressed and angry ; and I gain weight .
how can I cope with this ?
answer : an excessive appe@@ ti@@ te for food means in fact that your energy needs are not met .
the reason for this may be e@@ ating less or sk@@ ip@@ ping morning me@@ als and lun@@ ches .
another reason is your failure to di@@ g@@ est the food you eat .
to do this , your di@@ ges@@ tive system should work he@@ al@@ th@@ ily .
if you do not have a problem such as an ul@@ c@@ er , ref@@ lu@@ x or similar problems , the e@@ asi@@ est way is to use a good pro@@ bi@@ otic medicine .
you will greatly feel its benefits .
I cannot gain weight , doctors do not know the reason
generally there is information about losing weight in your col@@ um@@ n .
all of it seems lo@@ g@@ ical to me too , but my situation is a little bit different .
so@@ me@@ how I cannot gain weight .
the most important thing is I do not know why .
doctors do not say anything either .
answer : the te@@ ch@@ ni@@ ques we apply are not intended for losing weight , but also reg@@ ain@@ ing the physi@@ ological functions of the body and turning it into its ideal size .
being over@@ weight and being too th@@ in are the same kinds of dis@@ order .
failure to lose weight when f@@ at and failure to gain weight when slim are cu@@ red with the same te@@ ch@@ ni@@ que .
you lose weight more when you eat swe@@ ets and pas@@ tries .
I ima@@ g@@ ine you might have understood this by now .
it is also possible for you to be sti@@ mu@@ lated with Car@@ bo@@ x@@ y ther@@ ap@@ y and gain weight through a healthy di@@ et .
in other words , you became distant from your ideal body by losing weight .
other patients of ours became distant from their ideal bodies by putting on weight .
you will reach your ideal body by gaining weight , and they will do so by losing weight .
if the problem with the system is eliminated , you will gain weight , they will lose weight .
nevertheless , f@@ ir@@ st@@ ly the system should work properly .

in other words , they desire that their parents and social circ@@ le respect their decisions , their opinion is asked in matters related to them , and they are made to feel val@@ u@@ ed .
enabling them to create the base on which to construct a healthy person@@ ality .
for example , behaviour such as making decisions in matters rela@@ ting to the child ( what they wear , what they eat ) instead of the child , insisting on your truth without considering the wishes of the child ( sending a child to a music course even though they want to go to a football course ) means not res@@ p@@ ec@@ ting the person@@ ality of the child .
when their indi@@ vi@@ du@@ ality and being are not respected , children lose the freedom of &quot; being themselves &quot; and their defence mechanism reve@@ als emo@@ tions of anger and hatred in order to protect themselves .
st@@ at@@ ing that , &quot; The reason is that anger and hatred are in fact just op@@ pos@@ ites of acceptance , &quot; psych@@ ologist H@@ il@@ al Ar@@ s@@ lan says that children do not accept what is done to them by showing h@@ ate and they try to say to both themselves and the people around them that they are pre@@ ci@@ ous .
saying that it is good for their person@@ ality development that children do not accept the situation and react to it , the senior psych@@ ologist said , &quot; The hatred here means I am also here , it serves the children &apos;s aim to protect their self @-@ respect . &quot;
she says , &quot; I@@ f children are allowed to be individuals , the hatred will be eliminated . &quot;
children try to protect their self by res@@ or@@ t@@ ing to anger and hatred
saying that if children are exposed to the ver@@ b@@ al and emo@@ tional violence of their parents and sur@@ ro@@ un@@ dings , it will cause negative emo@@ tions in children in a time that they are at a young age and are both physi@@ cally and sp@@ ir@@ itu@@ ally most vulnerable , Ar@@ s@@ lan states that neg@@ li@@ gence will make the child feel that their existence is not noticed and they are in@@ visible .
Ar@@ s@@ lan continues with the following : &quot; maybe sometimes we can fail to meet the emo@@ tional needs ( not st@@ ro@@ king their ha@@ ir , not h@@ ug@@ ging and k@@ is@@ sing them , not car@@ ing about their school or other needs ) , and sometimes we can fail to meet also their physical needs ( e@@ ating , drinking , shelter , school needs et@@ c . ) . &quot;
this is a growing attitude that opens the doors to anger and hatred .
for emo@@ tional and ver@@ b@@ al violence , there is behaviour like hum@@ ili@@ ation , insulting , be@@ li@@ t@@ tling , s@@ col@@ ding , unnecessary and heavy punishment , making them feel wor@@ th@@ less and y@@ el@@ ling .
since this behaviour is towards the person@@ ality of the child , it has a deep effect .
&quot; children who accept it , lose their self @-@ respect and spend their lives struggling with the feeling that they are wor@@ th@@ less , un@@ wor@@ th@@ y of being lov@@ ed and inadequate , or they will protect themselves by res@@ or@@ t@@ ing to anger and hatred . &quot;
